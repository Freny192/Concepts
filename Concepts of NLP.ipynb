       "',6810,,,,Crash Description,\"Turned right from 38th and Nebraska into a gap in traffic. Car approached from behind and tried to pass too fast and too close, and car\\'s wing mirror hit my handlebars. Lost control of the bike and crashed on the pavement, hitting my head but sustaining no other injuries. Driver stopped, another witness stopped, both offered aid. Driver offered his name and phone number but I failed to ask for insurance info. Didn\\'t get witness\\'s name or phone number. Also, didn\\'t call the police as I didn\\'t think I was seriously injured at the time. Only later discovered I had a concussion and went to the ER. Filed a police report after the fact. Now stuck in an insurance fight to cover the medical treatment - I didn\\'t realize that car insurance is assumed to be the payer of first resort, not sure if my medical insurance will ultimately cover the treatment. Tried to contact the driver on multiple occasions but thus far getting no response. Would prefer not to go the lawyer route, but I\\'m not sure how else to find out his car insurance info. Any WABA advice welcome!\"\\n11310384,6810,WASHINGTON,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"While recovering from a turn, hit a parallel rut in the road and went down.\"\\n11310789,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was southbound on 3rd Street and saw a northbound motorist with his left signal on. I knew he didn\\'t have time to make the turn, so I held up my left arm/hand in a \"\"stop\"\" signal, and shouted \"\"NO\"\". But he made the turn anyway. I braked as hard as I could, but could not avoid colliding into the front right passenger door of his vehicle. Since this occurred just feet from the FBI parking garage entrance, I was immediately surrounded by police (I believe FBI police) who must have contacted police and an ambulance. The EMTs checked me for spinal and head injuries, and while they were doing that, there was a tall, thin African American woman who repeated (at least twice), \"\"He turned right in front of her. Right in front of her.\"\" The MPD officer who responded to the call was Officer Simms. He apparently took a deposition from the motorist while I was being put onto a body board and loaded into the ambulance. The EMT\\'s put a collar around my neck for precaution, so I could not tell who was asking me questions, but I was asked repeatedly the same questions (name, address, date of birth, age, social security number, was I wearing a helmet, phone, do you have pain here, how about here, etc). Officer Simms claims to have spoken to me in the ambulance during the time when I was still being pelted with the above questions. I have no recollection of his telling me he was Officer Simms and asking for my version of what happened. That\\'s not because I was confused or had head injuries. It\\'s because I was still in \"\"medical review\"\" mode. I had no idea Officer Simms was there and asking me about the accident. I knew someone asked me what happened, and I told them, but I did not know that was Officer Simms. I was concerned about my bicycle, and Officer Simms was kind enough to take my bike to the hospital for me. I saw him there, but he didn\\'t ask for a deposition.\"\\n11310797,6810,Falls Church,VA,22046,Crash Description,\"I was heading east on Custis trail into DC crossing N Lynn street in pedestrian crosswalk with green light. An Audi A4 waiting on the exit ramp from 66 abruptly turned right in front of me across the bicycle path. I swerved to avoid collision, but ended up crashing into rear of the car.\"\\n11311864,6810,Silver Spring,MD,20910,Crash Description,\"Driver swung open his door in my path as I biked north on 18th; I veered, but could not veer hard enough left to avoid the door. Right shoulder slammed into door; bike toppled left; scraped left elbow on the ground.\"\\n11312571,6810,Washington,DC,20017,Crash Description,\"As I wrote, I hit the ground with such force that I was knocked unconscious. I was about 1.5 miles from my house on a route I ride at least twice week (two or more round-trips). Nobody saw or heard the accident but several people found me in the road. One called an ambulance, which arrived within four minutes, and two large men pulled me and my bike to the curb. My helmet has a crease on the right side and I broke my right elbow in two places.\"\\n11312867,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"GMC Sierra drove at full city speed through a red light westbound on U Street NW at 11th Street NW. It hit a car traveling south on 11th Street NW. As it hit the southbound car, it swerved south and headed for me and another vehicle in the curb lane of U Street NW eastbound. I began to move out of the way but it hit the rear of my bicycle, knocking me and the bike to the ground. I slide a bit on U Street.\"\\n11313376,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I was riding south on Bladensburg Road. I was in the right turn only lane so that I could pass stopped traffic as I approached a red light. When I reached the light, I moved over to the crosswalk in front of the straight/right turn lane. At this same moment, the car at the front of the straight/right turn lane started to turn right on a green arrow.\"\\n11313437,6810,Arlington,VA,22203,Crash Description,Driver recklessly drove through a crosswalk with two lanes (three lane road) of traffic already stopped. I was hit when I followed a pedestrian into the third lane. The pedestrian was in front of me and pulled back at the last minute. I got hit.\\n11313487,6810,Washington,DC,20017,Crash Description,I was traveling north on 11 crossing through busy intersection right after crossing R traveling across Vermont - green light - when a car tried to get around me or I think was trying to take a right on Vermont? Car dragged me to the cross walk of Vermont. bike fine. My left elbow badly bruised. shoulder road burn. left shin bruise. pelvic bruise. slight back pain the next day. otherwise fine. Polic and anulance came to scene.\\n11314760,6810,Mount Rainier,MD,20712,Crash Description,\"I was biking home from work on my regular route. I had my headlight, tail light, and a reflective vest on. I passed a darkened car that did not appear to be on, and the door popped open as I passed, hitting me and tossing me into the street. Fortunately there was no oncoming traffic. The man got out, having not seen me, apologized, asked if I was OK. I was a little bruised, but otherwise OK. Bike was fine.\"\\n11315301,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"I was on my newly revived mountain bike. I was not used to how wide the handles are and when I met a bike with similar WIDE handles, I got over as far as I could to the right (I was headed westbo8und) and he either clipped me or I clipped the railing to my right. I then lost control, veered into the other side of the bike path, and literally fell over the miniscule low guardrail into traffic on I66 BUT luckily by the grace of God and my Mother and Grandmothers in heaven, there were no cars coming. My bike stayed on the bikepath and I scurried back over, with just some bruises and scrapes VERY lucky to be alive...\"\\n11672003,6810,Alexandria,VA,22307,Crash Description,\"I was riding south on Royal in Old Towne Alexandria, staying to the right of traffic. Cars were passing to my left. There are a series of stop signs along Royal Street, which means cars and bikes end up going about the same speed. At the intersection of Royal and Gibbon, I continued straight at a stop sign, as did the cab next to me-- that is until he changed his mind and turned right with no blinker--a classic right hook. I was nearly able to stop, but was still clipped on the left from the right turning cab. My front wheel was destroyed, I tumbled off the bike but luckily had nothing worse than road rash. The cabbie stayed; a couple of people called 911 for me. Cabbie exchanged insurance info with me immediately, was apologetic and helpful. He even put my bike in his car and drove me to where I needed to go.\"\\n11673088,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"At about 5:30 pm I entered the intersection of 16th and Florida traveling southbound on 16th —traffic was stopped in both directions despite a green light and 15 seconds more to go for the crossing. Just as I entered, a north bound Honda CRV went from a stop to suddenly turning left onto Florida Avenue west bound. I did a panicked stop, and went over my handlebars, landing on my head and face. Yes, I was wearing a helmet. He did stop on FL Avenue, and said he was sorry it happened, but he didn’t want to be a jerk, but noted he was not in my lane. I was bleeding—but still had my teeth and could more all limbs. No LOC. A pedestrian called 911 for an ambulance and stayed. It took about 15 minutes for EMS to arrive—police followed shortly afterwards. There was a crack in my helmet from the impact. EMS pointed out the helmet damage and that I would need sutures, so I agreed, and they put me and my bike into the ambulance, and took me there. (I did give a statement to the police.)\"\\n11674146,6810,Arlington,VA,22204,Crash Description,He sideswiped me while I was in the right side of the right lane on a bikeshare bike while going about 30 mph trying to catch the green light. I swerved a lot but stayed upright. He did not stop. Do not know for sure that he knew he hit me. Policeman later mentioned that it was an elderly driver.\\n11674337,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was cycling home north on 13th street. I entered Logan Circle and went into the innermost lane. No cars were in the quarter of the circle I was in as I entered the circle. About an eighth of the way around, I heard cars entering and looked over my shoulder to see if I could safely change lanes to the lane to my right. I didn\\'t see any cars in that lane so I moved over and saw a clear lane in front of me when I looked up at the light. I saw the light turning yellow so I tried to rush to make it. I put my head down for a brief time to build up momentum / keep the rain out of my eyes. When I looked up again there was a car coming to a stop in front of me and I was 5 - 10 feet behind the car when I noticed it and started to brake. Given that the lane was clear when I took the glance down I suspect that the driver must have realized that the lane they were in would force them to leave the circle and travel eastbound on Rhode Island Avenue rather than wherever they were attempting to go. My recollection is that the driver changed lanes quickly and came to an abrupt stop in front of me. I attempted to swerve around the right rear of the car but clipped it and went over the handlebars and hit my head.\"\\n11674629,6810,Woodbridge,VA,22192,Crash Description,A group of cyclists was travelling north on the GW parkway. A golden brown Cadillac was travelling south. The Cadillac made a U turn and sped past the cyclists and turned his car sharply at a 90 degree angle in front of the cyclists so that the cyclists crashed into the car. One man went under the car. The driver backed up and without regard for the injured cyclist sped off down Collingwood Road. A motorist who witnessed the hit and run tried to follow but the driver was able to get away in the neighborhoods.\\n12006099,6810,Arlington,VA,22201,Crash Description,\"I chose to cycle between traffic waiting at a red light and a row of parked cars. A kid swung his SUV door open just as I was passing. Given the line of cars to my left and my speed I was only able to swerve my front tire past the door, which caught my handlebar and right shoulder. I was thrown into the roadway between two cars and equally luckily the red light didn\\'t. I hold the driver responsible for dooring me, but I chose the route, which had no bailout potential.\"\\n12006533,6810,Washington,DC,20433,Crash Description,I was crossing the street on my bike at the crosswalk & put my hand up to say STOP to the Van making an illegal left turn from 19th Street onto VA Ave. Alas still paying for it today\\n12006626,6810,Washington,DC,20012,Crash Description,\"I was biking north on Illinois avenue. I got in the middle of the lane to prepare to turn left on Ingraham. As I was about to signal a left turn, I sensed a very fast moving vehicle approaching me from behind. As I tried to move right, the passing vehicle clipped my left arm with its mirror. It made a loud noise, which I think was probably its mirror folding in. It didn\\'t knock me over, and I got over to the side of the road to check myself out. The car never slowed down but it must have known what happened. It happened so quickly that I didn\\'t get any description beyond \"\"dark sedan.\"\" I got a scrape on my arm but nothing significant and my bike wasn\\'t touched, so I continued home and then filed a police report.\"\\n12007610,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"I didn\\'t see the collision, but as far as I\\'ve been able to piece it together, by speaking with eyewitnesses, the bicyclist entered the northern crosswalk traveling east on Euclid (across 16th) at the end of the yellow light or possibly the very first moment of a red light. He was struck by a dark colored Toyota Solara with MD plate 4az4823. The driver remained at the scene and appeared to give a statement to the police. The bicyclist sustained injuries including lacerations on the back of his head. He was taken via ambulance to a hospital.\"\\n12007680,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"Headed south bound on 11th, I was stopped at the light at U. The light changed and I proceeded, taking the lane since this is a very narrow section of 11th. Cars ahead of me were only about 3 car lengths ahead and proceeding at the same speed so I was not impeding traffic in any way. About a half block after crossing U I noticed the car behind me, a red PT Cruiser, revving it\\'s engine and the driver yelling (her windows were open). This continued through stopping at the stop sign at T. I could not make out everything she was saying but lots of cursing and \"\"get out of the way\"\" \"\"you are\\'t a car\"\" were among what she said. As I was still just realizing what all was happening I noticed a police car stopped ahead at the Vermont intersection, the officer was out of the car but I was able to yell to him as we stopped at the light. I explained that the woman was driving threateningly, yelling, etc. He walked over and talked to the woman explaining that bikes are vehicles and have every right to be in the road. She was defiant and borderline abusive through that conversation but he let her go after only a short conversation, only lasting the length of the red light. I thanked the Officer for intervening and went on my way, a bit shaken but overall fine. As I rode down 11th I eventually passed this woman at I think N st. (cars were backed up significantly for that stretch, bike lanes were open) and while I passed her without any direct interaction I could hear yelling a few seconds later. At the next light I asked another cyclist that was behind me about it and she confirmed the woman was essentially behaving the same. With a little reflection and given the second interaction, I wish I would have pushed for more action from the Officer. This woman, intending to or not was putting others in significant danger. At the least, the officer should have kept her there long enough to calm her down and defuse further threatening behavior. While I was a little to in shock to realize it as it was happening she was very much threatening to hit me with her car, I get that the officer did not witness that part but I did describe what was happening and he saw how agitated she was. I ride with a gopro on my handle bars so I have video of this span but it faces forward and captured very little of the audio so not super useful. It does show the car and license plate.\"\\n12008891,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"Riding my bike southbound on Conn. Av on the far right lane right before Porter St, the driver made a u turn kept on driving and hit me from behind. He claimed to not have seen me on my bike, while there was enough light. I wearing a bright red cycling jacket, a white helmet and my rear light was on.\"\\n12009746,6810,HYATTSVILLE,MD,20782,Crash Description,\"I approached the intersection cautiously westbound. A pedestrian was standing up against the telephone pole limiting my view of southbound traffic. Northbound lane was clear. Three other cyclists crossed eastbound. I entered the intersection and crossed the northbound lane. When I entered the southbound lane I suddenly heard the engine of a car and turned away in an attempt to avoid a direct hit but was not able to evade. I was struck fully, my body broke the windshield of the car then fell to the road.\"\\n12353223,6810,Vienna,VA,22180,Crash Description,\"I was riding eastbound in the L Street cycletrack, approaching a \"\"mixing zone.\"\" A motorist in the left lane abruptly turned left across the cycletrack to enter a parking garage. I was able to brake so that the impact was at a slow speed. No damage to myself, my bike or the vehicle. I could see the driver through her window right before impact. She was looking at her phone in her lap. She had no apprehension of the impending crash until I hit her car door. She was executing a left turn without looking at the road or her mirrors.\"\\n12514588,6810,\"Washington, DC\",DC,20019,Crash Description,\"I committing on the sidewalk coming from Benning Rd towards Florida Ave. The light was green as I approached the crosswalk intersection and cars were doing left hooks so I slowed down even more, I was already going at a very slow speed because I was on the sidewalk, as a set of cars made their left hook I let them, as I approached the crosswalk I continued to go across as a car was finishing passing my path, then another car coming into my path of the crosswalk as they did a left hook, I noticed was not slowing down as I tried to go across the street, so in order to not get hit from the side I made a tight as possible turn back into the right corner of the car and the car still continued to approach me at the same speed, I did not have enough clearance to fully make the turn so the front of my tire was directly in front of their car, as they got closer they still did not stop, at this point they were already starting to crush my front tire, I proceeded to still turn out of their way, they still did not stop until my right side was finally facing the front of their car and at that point I had started to eject out of the bicycle and my entire bike was underneath the front of their, at that point I threw my hands up in anger and pointed at what was still a green light for me, they did not get out of the car to ask if I was ok, I myself went around to their window to ask why. A police officer was near by but not close enough to see the entire accident. He came over to ask if everyone was ok then proceeded to call the proper officer for that district, that officer came took the report. Fire trucks came but were not needed, I had a coworker come and take me to urgent care at kaiser and put my bicycle in his car. We left the scene a few minutes after everyone involved had already left and finished exchanging what we needed to.\"\\n13064047,6810,Washington,DC,20012,Crash Description,\"I\\'m riding along heading south on 13th St, taking the lane. I hear a car behind me start honking, and he leans on his horn for an entire block, until we both come to a stop at a red light. I glide into the crosswalk (no pedestrians in sight). He pulls up next to me with the bumper of his ginormous SUV about six inches from my knee. His passenger rolls down her window and he proceeds to yell at me about how I need to get off the road because I\\'m only allowed to ride in a bike lane. I try to calmly explain that no, DC law says I can take the lane and oh, by the way, you need to give me three feet to pass. He keeps yelling. The light changes and he sits there. I move forward, and he passes me way to close. He stops at the stop sign a block ahead, and sits there. I ride up behind him, stop, and sit there. There are no other cars around. I wait, he doesn\\'t move. I pull up on his right, he starts yelling at me again, I move through the intersection and he passes me again, gets to the stop sign, and sits there. I pull up behind him. By now there are two or three cars lined up behind me. We sit. And sit. I make the \"\"I don\\'t know what he\\'s doing\"\" arms-in-the shrug air gesture to the driver behind me. He starts honking, then the other two start honking, and finally SUV Driver moves through the intersection. I move to the right (lucky break in the parked cars) so the other three cars can pass and get between me and the SUV, and hopefully everyone got where they were going safely. Truly, this is a first - I\\'ve never had a driver inconvenience himself just for the chance to yell at me about how bicyclists are all scum.\"\\n13722239,6810,Brookeville,MD,20833,Crash Description,\"I was riding my bicycle home from work Friday at about 5:30PM. After going through a “T” intersection, I was riding down the street with no cars in front of me and a line of stopped cars to my left. All of a sudden a car from the line of stopped cars pulls in front of me going to his left to get on to a side street. I had to squeeze my brakes so hard to not hit the car that my rear wheel went up into the air, probably about 3-4 feet off the pavement. I just missed hitting the car but fell to my left on to the pavement. At least two Samaritans stopped to help me move to the side of the road (and my bicycle also). Two chase down the car to get the license plate and texted it, including car model and color to me. It was Papa John delivery car so it was easy to find. I was bloodied and the bicycle had minor damage. I rested for a while and determined that I was able to complete my ride home, in some pain. After I got home found that the pain was not receding. I went to Montgomery General Emergency and was told that I have three broken ribs and a partially collapsed lung. A chest tube was inserted and I stayed two nights. Saturday morning, I call the Montgomery PD and they sent an officer to my room in hospital to take a report. The officer was very nice and took down the information or where, when, travel directions and the license plate number. He was able to get me the name of the owner of the car and the insurance department. He told me that because there was no collision, he cannot file an accident report. He can file a traffic ticket but that would require that I and a witness go to police department to complete it. I asked if I need to contact him and he basically said that any police officer can do it. He also mentioned his lieutenant advised the witness be contacted and that a report and be written and filed which he said he did. Following my returning home from hospital, I call the Montgomery PD to see which police depart would be most convenient for me and the witness that I had contacted to go to. I ask about how I should refer to the report and I was told that the intersection, date and time would all that was needed. I made arrangement for the witness and me to go to the Police Department on 100 Edison Park Drive, Gaithersburg. Upon arriving, this was mid-day, there were hardly any parking available but I digress. I went through metal detector and information told me to go to doors on left, department 1D. This is a small waiting room with counter/windows that look into a large room with a few non-uniformed people in there in front of monitors. Nobody was near the counter. I finally got the attention of one of the people in the room and came over to talk to me. I explained that I and a witness was here to finish filing the report about my accident. I described to him what happen at the accident and the officer came to my hospital room to take the report and how he had advise me to come to police department. This person went “dumb” on me. He cannot find the report. There was no accident. Which officer was it? Policemen do not have file report of accidents or traffic violations, even with two or more citizens coming forward. There is nothing he can do for me. Go talk to the insurance company, this has nothing to do with police department. Essentially he was saying go away and quit bothering me. I do not know how many of you have encounter the Montgomery police department the way I have. The officer at the hospital was helpful. The phone line contact was pleasant and helpful but at district 1 on 100 Edison Park Drive, it was woefully inadequate. Very little activity going on even with a full (large) parking lot. It really ticked me off because I wasted a good Samaritan’s time to no avail. I am looking for advice going forward from here. I can call the driver’s insurance company but without a police report/traffic ticket, it would be more difficult to make a claim. If any of you have experience in this area please advise. This is also a tale of bicycle vs. car. Though it is wiser to not collide with a car when on a bicycle, the laws in MD/MC seems to make that a poor choice. The law seems require that a potential life threatening collision before it will act. Cyclists are on their own if they damage themselves trying to avoid collision with motor vehicles.\"\\n14242211,6810,Alexandria,VA,22301,Crash Description,\"Car passed me and another cyclist northbound on GW Parkway 3 mi south of Alexandria, cut back into right most part of lane to hug the edge, and then slammed on the brakes cause me to swerve and hit the rear of the car.\"\\n14513552,6810,washington,DC,20036,Crash Description,\"I am cycling east on Newton St NE approaching a 4 way stop sign at 18th & Newton. First, a white van traveling north on 18th St goes through the intersection. Then I brake for the intersection. I can see the only other motorist hasn\\'t yet stopped or reached the intersection. I\\'m riding my day-glow bike and am wearing a highly reflective jacket, a pulsing LED light on the helmet, a flashing tail light and a set of revolights. I enter the intersection. Meanwhile, the motorist does not stop and rolls into the intersection without checking for others. Failing to look, she enters and causes a crash since she failed to yield to existing users of the intersection. Note that the GoPro 960 performs poorly in low light. The recording appears darker than it was to the human eye. https://vimeo.com/80909922 This is a transcript of the conversation between the motorist and cyclist: Cyclist: dx9019. what the hell? what the hell, buddy? dx9019.

When the line of illegally parked cars ended, the car on my left pulled to the right to get into that lane without signalling. I tried to slow and pull to the right but was not able to quickly enough and was knocked over. I sustained bruises to my left hip,; cuts, scrapes, and bruises to my left elbow, and a broken mirror. To add insult to injury, I had bought eggs at the farmers market and was taking them home in my panniers and several of them broke as well. The car stopped and the driver was very apologetic. I emphasized that he should always use his turn signals.\"\\n19882836,6810,Falls Church,VA,22041,Crash Description,\"I was riding northbound, in the leftmost part of the right lane (any more to the left and I would have put myself in danger of rush-hour traffic--and possibly be charged with obstructing traffic). I was traveling in a straight line at 8.5 mph, as I found later when reviewing the GPS record of my ride, and was passing a parked taxi in which I did not discern any passengers or driver--possibly on account of my wearing polarized lenses (windows often look dark when seen at a certain angle). The taxi driver opened his door suddenly, giving me virtually no reaction time to swerve. The far edge of the taxi door hit me in the neck, knocking me off my bicycle. I fell to the ground hard (on my left hand, I surmise, as much later my left pinky finger became very stiff and painful). However, my immediate concern was my neck: I had a sudden flash of pain where the door hit me, on the right side of my neck halfway between my collarbone and my ear.\"\\n19890904,6810,Silver Spring,MD,20902,Crash Description,\"I entered the pedestrian crosswalk that crosses N. Lynn St at Lee Hwy. The crosswalk showed the white sign for safe pedestrian crossing. The traffic signal for cars on N. Lynn St was red. The car proceeded through the red light and veered toward me, in what seemed like an intentional \"\"brush back.\"\" I was not hit, nor did I fall down. This was observed by cyclists crossing from the other side of the crosswalk. This is the third time I have had close calls at this crossing, which is exceedingly dangerous during morning and evening commutes. Cars heading into DC, making a right turn onto Lynn will often try to intimidate cyclists in the pedestrian lane. Yesterday there was a police vehicle parked in the area adjacent to this crossing. This deters aggressive motorists, but when the police vehicle is absent, it seems like a daily case of \"\"chicken\"\" for cyclists who are legally crossing the pedestrian walkway with the light.\"\\n19895568,6810,Hyattsville,MD,20782,Crash Description,\"I was traveling east in the right lane on U St. NW, just to the left of parked cars. The traffic was very light for what is usually a busy street. There were no more than 6 cars in motion on the block at the time, including both directions of traffic. I was riding with the flow of traffic. As I crossed 14th St, a commercial van switched into my lane and gunned the accelerator, bearing down on me at high speed while the driver shouted and gestured at me. I didn\\'t want to move into the left lane because the van obscured my view and I couldn\\'t see if other cars were coming. I eased as far right into the door zone as I dared and the van passed me on my left by inches, still accelerating, with the driver still gesturing and shouting. The van was moving fast enough to wind buffet me in passing. The light turned red at 13th St. so I ended up next to the van driver at the light. He shouted at me some more and I rode onto the sidewalk to calm myself. I did not respond to the driver.\"\\n20155478,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I had recently changed lanes from the bike lane on the right to the right car lane to the left car lane.

There was a double-parked car ahead of me, which was blocking the bike lane. I knew there was a bus behind me, so I looked behind me to determine if I had enough time/space to pass the double-parked car before the bus passed. I determined that I had enough time/space, so I exited the bike lane in order to go around the parked car. Instead of slowing down and waiting for me to get back into the bike lane after passing the parked car, the bus passed me while I was outside the bike lane. The bus passed me too closely, and I was sideswiped by the bus\\' right hand side, near the rear of the bus (behind the bus\\' back doors).

As I was about to remount in the crosswalk I noticed a car traveling West that did not appear to be planning to stop at the cross walk. The pedestrian entering the cross walk apparently sensed the same thing, as she stopped crossing. I attempted to pull my bike out of the way, but stumbled and fell in the gutter. The driver braked hard and stopped with his nose in the cross walk. I reminded him that this is a cross walk and proceeded on my way. I then noticed that my hand was hurting, and later discovered that I had torn a tendon in my right thumb and sprained another finger. The thumb required surgical repair.\"\\n27469561,6810,Rockville,MD,20852,Crash Description,The vechicle was stopped at the stop sign at the intersection of Hampden Ln and Arlington Rd (east side of Arlington). I was travelling south and stopped at the intersection. I proceeded into the crosswalk on my bike (I assumed the car was not going to pull out because of the traffic on Arlington Rd so I did not make eye contact with the driver). I was on a red Specialized bike and wearing a neon yellow bike jacket and helmet. It was a beautiful clear day. The driver drove into my left leg (calf) knocking me and my bike over (sideways). An ambulance was called and I have photos and a witness phone number. The ENT determined I did not have a broken bone because I could put weight on my leg so I did not go in the ambulance to the hospital. Later my knee got quite swollen so I went to suburban emergeny room where they treated it as a sprain (no broken bone on Xray).

This is very disturbing. In some cases, it has appeared that the person was on their phone and not paying attention. In at least two cases, the person was making the left turn at U Street and they have a red turn arrow for the first 20 seconds or thereabouts so that bikes and pedestrians may cross, but the drivers ignored the red turn arrow and went anyway. I\\'ve also nearly been run into by a car turning left on a red turn arrow further down (south) on 15th St (I think the car was turning onto one of the one way streets going west). Generally, I feel that 15th St is about the safest place for a cyclist in the city, but I am deeply disturbed by all the cars illegally turning left on red turn arrows and turning into/across bike and pedestrian traffic. I don\\'t know if there need to be bigger signs and lights, or what the fix is, but it scares me as a regular cyclist on 15th St. Also, I\\'ve only noticed the problem only in the evening when I am north-bound, so I\\'m not sure if it\\'s a factor of heavier/different traffic in the evenings, or something else (I also bike a bit further north on 15th St in the evenings and two incidents have been at U St, which I do not cross in the morning).\"\\n27641633,6810,Silver Spring,MD,20901,Crash Description,I was in the bike proceeding straight.

He was attempting to make a right turn on red and was looking left at the traffic traveling north so he did not see me. I dodged the car by 1 ft by swerving right, but this put me in the path of an iron post that holds the stoplights for this intersection. I swerved to the left to avoid the iron post and this caused the bike to lose control. I fell to the left and had minor injuries.\"\\n32825835,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was heading southbound on Georgia Avenue in the West-most traffic lane (though there is a parking lane as well). At the bottom of the hill, at the intersection with Barry Place cars were turning right and I made my way around them and into the bike/bus lane. As I did so, I overtook a red minivan that was in the bike/bus lane just past the McDonald\\'s. When I got in front of the van in the bus/bike only lane (now the West-most lane since the parking lane disappears at Barry Pl.), I sensed that they were close behind me. When I looked they were close behind me (1 car length of less). I put my hand down to signal that they needed to slow down, to which they did not really respond. I was probably going around 10-12 mph at the time. At this point, I coasted and started pointing that they needed to be into the car lane and was yelling at them to \"\"get out of this fucking lane\"\". Not the most polite language, but I was feeling the heat, to be sure. Figuring they were not going to move at this point, I started to pedal again (still in the middle of the bus/bike only lane). At this point the minivan must have accelerated (I was not looking back), and then they clipped the rear half of my back tire and my derailleur, etc. they came from the right side to the left, and my bike collapsed immediately as the rear wheel snapped in half. I fell slightly into the side of the van and slid partially off of the rear passenger side of the minivan and slid along the asphalt. A man on a motorbike stopped and saw to me and helped me move out of the way of traffic once we determined I was able to move. A man on a bicycle also helped determine where the van went. The driver of the van initially did not stop and drove up about 2 blocks. There was a federal officer (Secret Service) who saw the hit and run and detained the driver until the police could come. DCFD came by and looked me over, called an ambulance for me, and I was transported to Howard University ER (which is right across the street). The woman who owned the van, and had been a passenger, came up to me when I was with DCFD and was saying that it was my fault and how I was in the wrong lane, which is odd, since I was in a bright red and clearly marked bike/bus only lane.\"\\n32889214,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was heading eastbound on Columbia road. The road between Euclid and Ontario is particularly narrow without a bike lane and there were cars passing on my left so I was riding closer the the parking lane than usual.

As I almost arrived at the end of the intersection I decided to get on the road to provide more space between me and the cars as they were eagerly waiting for the light to turn green. As the light turned green I was already past the intersection, and the last car saw me and accelerated and followed me on the left side of the street and tried to run me over. I was hit on the rear wheel as I was trying to escape to the left. Likely I did not fall, but I was very shook up. The car made it to the next intersection, where it stopped at a red light. I put my bike in front of the car and asked for assistance to call the police. Somebody called the police. The security service police came. After a long discussion the police filed a report: CC#002547. But there is nothing more they could.

I entered the crosswalk over Mateney Road on a green light / walk signal. A driver in a car that was stopped before the crosswalk, on my left, drove forward to make a right-on-red just as I was passing, and I was knocked down onto my right side. I was wearing a bright orange rain cape, and my bike had a lit headlamp and flashing tail lamp. The irony is, I usually commute from Germantown to Key West Hwy at Shady Grove Rd via Rt 118, Riffle Ford Rd and Rt 28. I\\'ve never had a crash going that way. Since it was raining today, I thought that I would be safer off the road, so I took the path along Great Seneca Highway. Ha! Serves me right for trusting a bike path. The highway is divided here, so at intersections, right-turners have no incentive to look to their right, hence the invisible bicyclist. The driver was shocked and very apologetic, and offered my his phone number in case I needed to follow up. Well, at least one driver was educated about looking both ways today.

After about an hour, the crime scene people come by, they take two pictures of my bike, and they let me go. The things that bother me the most about this are: 1) They threatened to give me a ticket, and lied about the law. 2) They never told me what the law actually says. 3) They made me wait at the side of the road for an hour, when I repeatedly told them I needed to be home.\"\\n35116431,6810,Washington,DC,20007,Crash Description,\"stop sign - I did not see turn signal and turned head, started creeping forward from stop sign; when looked back, car had turned left and i could not avoid it\"\\n35907251,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"In traveling down the 5th Street NW bike lane, you must traverse Scott Circle.

A woman was lying in the street with a crashed BikeShare bike by her side. This has gotten press coverage an a photo of the scene from a nearby building was published in The Washington Post online and dcist.com. Regarding the last question on this form, feel free to follow up with me if it would be helpful, but I don\\'t need for you to do so.\"\\n36193188,6810,Washington,DC,20012,Crash Description,\"In summary - traveling south bound on 4th St NW, dark blue small SUV tried to push me over into the parked cars on 4th St NW. Took evasive action to avoid going under the car. Fell to the pavement. Concussion, scrapes, bruises. Was totally too out of it to call Police or 911. I\\'m an idiot... I was just so out of it. In further detail, I was coming down the hill on 4th St NW as I do every morning, since I ride year-round (for years) and I took about 2/5 the lane to avoid the dooring zone through that area. Dark Blue SUV decided to pass me with about 2 inches from his mirror to my handlebar (freaked me out being that close). He appeared to be shoving me over (maybe because he felt I was taking up too much room on the road?) and I freaked out and pushed against his car to avoid going under it and fell to the ground in the process. I\\'m just soo happy I didn\\'t go under his car or have any broken bones or brain bleeding (confirmed by xray and CT scan at ER later).\"\\n36208101,6810,Bethesda,MD,20814,Crash Description,\"The SUV rear-ended my bike. It was driving directly behind me in the center lane of traffic on 13th St. NW. As we headed toward K St. NW, the cars in front of me slowed down while the approaching intersection and I slowed down accordingly. Suddenly the front bumper of the SUV collided with the rear wheel of my bicycle. I was thrown over the handlebars and landed on the pavement.\"\\n36215612,6810,Fairfax,VA,22030,Crash Description,\"I\\'m not sure exactly what happened. I was riding along M Street on the south side, headed for the 21st/M Capital BikeShare station. I heard a crash from behind me and suddenly found myself flying through the air and, VERY shortly thereafter, on M Street with the wind throroughly knocked out of me. My best guess is that a car swiped my rear wheel from behind. I have been back to the site a couple of times since then, and there were no obstructions, parked cars, or anything else that I could have hit. I was going straight, not turning.\"\\n36251510,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"US Park Police Officer Christensen (202) 690-5089 took report/case# 12-77937 at 1000 hrs (10:00am) [ Call (202) 6197120 for official record and report ] after crash which occurred around 9:30am as I was crossing the two-lane road going north along the bike/ped trail on the cross walk at the George Washington Parkway ramp to Arlington Memorial Circle. The parkway was filled with rush hour traffic. I stopped at the intersection of the bike/ped path and the parkway, waited for moving vehicles to stop, vehicles in the south lane had stopped. I raised my hand high in the air to acknowledge them and get the attention of any motorists on the north lane that might not have seen me. As I crossed into the north lane, a Red Top Taxi approached the crosswalk and did not slow down as the driver proceeded to clip me on the right side. I had honestly expected that he had seen me and was about to slow down. It\\'s hard to believe that he could not see me or could not slow down/stop. The Red Top Taxi driver did stop in the north lane a few yards beyond me after the crash. All cars in both lanes remained stopped until I got up and walked north to the other side of the parkway back onto the bike/ped path where I stood until the driver got out of his car and came up to speak to me. At least one minute transpired as I checke my own condition, and briefly looked at my bike in my right hand. I was scrached but not seriously injured as I conveyed to the offending Red Top Taxi driver. None of the cars in the parkway had moved. A few joggers passed me and told me the witnessed the incident. Although shaken, I felt okay, thought my bike was okay to ride, so in the interest of not belaboring the issue and to allow the joggers and what was likely a half to a full mile of motorvehicle traffic on the parkway to proceed, I told the taxi driver and others that it was okay to leave. I was so shaken that I didn\\'t have the prsencee of mind to do what I would normally have done and take a picture/recording of the incident (aside from a couple of brief Twitter posts) much less take the drivers license and taxi id. I did have a good impression of the drive and knew I had the taxi company info. Seconds after the Red Top Taxi driver left, I discoverd that I was not able to ride my bike because the front fork and tire appeared to be severely damaged. So, I walked toward the Arlington Memorial Circle where I saw a motorcycle patrol officer who called US Park Police Officer Christensen and who both -- eventually -- too my incident report. It took several minutes, once Ofc Christensen arrived, to reason with the officers to even take an incident report. They claimed initially that there was no point in taking a report since no crime was committed considering that I told the taxi driver he could go and without taking his contact information. It took some pleading, but they ultimately agreed to give me a report so I could pass it along to my insurance company as well as Red Top Taxi. I called Red Top Taxi while with the officers and explained the incident and asked them to send out an call asking the offended taxi driver to identify himself and send a taxi to take me home. Red Top sent a cab to give me and my bike a courtesy ride home. Soon after I arrived at home, a representative from Red Top Taxi called me. Apparently the offending driver had identified himself to them and the company had agreed to cover all expenses related to the bike damage without any further dispute. I had called my insurance compmany, Allstate, to alert them, but Red Top Taxi reps apparently put a claim form in the mail and told me to mail it back with appropriate receipts so they could cover charges. I\\'m told I was lucky that this happened with a large taxi company driver and not and individual hacker and that this happened in Virginia and not DC where it might not have been resolved so expediditously. Apparently Red Top Taxi, a Virginia company, has all their taxis equipped iwth GPS, so that dispatchers are aware at all times where their taxis are to easily locate and track them. Such practices are apparently due to go into effect for all DC taxis in the upcoming year. I write this report from the comfort of my home the same evening of the incident. I can confirm that aside from minor scratches I seem physically okay. My personal safety and well being have been my primary concern, not damage to my bike or punishing the driver for what appears to have been an unfortunate accident without malicious intent. My bike maintenance friends at the Bicycle Pro Shop in Georgetown have my bike and are evaluating it for damages which I should hear more about by the end of the week. They will assess damages and give me a report which I can pass along to Red Top Taxi company. Aside from scratches, loss of bike, and inconvenience, I realize that I am lucky to be alive and that because of the driver\\'s apparent honesty and the efficiency of the Red Top Taxi company, this incident ended much better than many car v. bike crashes.\"\\n36284201,6810,Washington,DC,20018,Crash Description,\"Riding west on the Irving St sidepath, I was in the crosswalk. The driver was looking to the left to make a right turn on red off of First onto eastbound Irving, failed to look right (or even straight ahead) and accelerated as I was passing in front of her. She hit my rear wheel with her driver side bumper. I stayed upright, and was unhurt. The only evident damage to my bike is the rear fender, which is bent. The driver stayed at the scene and supplied her insurance information.\"\\n36284208,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"Heading east down D st in the bike lane, I approached a stop sign and came to a complete stop.

Driver was arrested after failing alcohol blood test and car was towed.\\n36299499,6810,Hyattsville,MD,20782,Crash Description,\"I was traveling on fourth Street north east. I waited for the green right turn signal. The right Green arrow illuminated and I made the right turn the right turn onto Michigan Avenue towards Hyattsville. Upon turning onto Michigan, after a few pedals I looked behind me. There were no vehicles in my lane behind me; I continued to paddle and within seconds, I was hit from behind and launched into the air. Upon landing on the ground in the right lane where I was traveling, I slid for a distance. When my body came to a stop I was in pain and laying on the ground still. I could not move my body but my eyes were open and I could hear people and cars moving by. A woman approached and said 911 has been called . A person asked me if I was okay and finally the police officer, Trusdale spelled TRUSDALE, approached me and said help is on the way, she then began to question me. I did overhear the police officer and the same woman discussing the accident. The office soon began questioning me again confirming my condition and other questions. Eventually the paramedics arrived and prepared me for Transportation to MEDSTAR.\"\\n36496616,6810,Washington,DC,20007,Crash Description,\"Coming down Mass Ave on sidewalk/bike lane. As I crossed Obsevatory Circle at green light, tractor trailer truck pulled right from Mass Ave in front of me. Hit breaks, toppled over and slid under truck. It stopped just before it rolled over me.\"\\n36540267,6810,Takoma Park,MD,20912,Crash Description,\"The intersection of the WB&A trail and Bell Station Rd is a blind crossing with a short downhill on the trail approaching the intersection. There is a stop sign for trail users, no stop sign for motorists. The cyclist came down the hill and into the crossing without stopping, and was hit head on by the vehicle. Driver did not appear to be speeding but had no chance to stop to avoid the cyclist. Driver did stop immediately after the crash and remained on the scene. Cyclist was seriously injured. I was not involved in the crash.\"\\n36804461,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was changing lanes when my front tire got caught in a metal trench. The rest of the trench is filled in with a rubber strip, but in the spot where I happened to crash, the rubber had fallen down into the concrete. I was thrown from my bike and blacked out for about 20 min. I was definitely concussed, and when I came to I was very confused and disoriented. I couldn\\'t remember where I was or where I was going.\"\\n37065519,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was riding west on Rhode Island Ave. -- my daily commute for five years. The car was also westbound. It was in the center lane of traffic and I was in the right lane. Without signalling, the car suddenly did a right hook across my path, turning onto westbound R Street. I slammed the brakes and swerved to avoid hitting its ride side, since it cut me off. This caused me to fall into Rhode Island Avenue. Thankfully, the cars behind saw me, so I was not hit by oncoming traffic. While on the ground, I raised me hand and yelled, but the car did not stop. In fact, it kept driving about a half mile, from 7th St. NW all the way past 13th St. NW. Thankfully, I only had a bruise, and scratches on my bike, so I pursued the motorist. When I caught up to her, yelled, and photographed her Maryland license plate 39158CE, THEN she pulled over and spoke to me. She claims to have not seen me, and \"\"had no where to pull over\"\". I said there were plenty of places to pull over, I could\\'ve been killed, and everyone on the road should be aware of their surroundings at all times.\"\\n37354198,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,Driver failed to check his blind spot before opening his door. Luckily I was far enough along that the door was opened right into my ankle resulting in only swelling a soreness for a couple of days.\\n37530376,6810,Washington,DC,20015,Crash Description,\"Collision with car results in $25 ticket to bicyclist. Yes, this was I. This was during rush hour, around 9AM. Southbound traffic was stalled at the traffic light intersection of Connecticut and Yuma. I had a green light traveling south on Connecticut. The Connecticut traffic had left a gap at the intersection (as you do) for Yuma traffic to pass between. Otherwise the southbound traffic along Connecticut was stopped before and after the intersection. I proceeded ahead in the lane break between the parked cars on the right and the stopped cars on the left. Unseen by me a northbound car along Connecticut makes a left turn onto Yuma and moves in front of me just at that moment and thus I collided with the right side of this vehicle.\"\\n38538517,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I was crossing 11th Street in the crosswalk, having made sure that I had the right of way. There were no stopped vehicles going north or south on 11th when I entered the crosswalk. A car with D.C. plates appeared driving south on 11th. The driver did not stop at the stop sign at 11th and D, but breezed right through it. She had slowed down the car, but did not stop for me. She glided her car broadside into me, and the bike and I went over. The car stopped after hitting me; the driver sat in it, unresponsive to my shouting (I was not cursing), for about 45 seconds, and then got out and asked me mechanically if I was hurt. I picked up my bike and walked to the curb, where I encountered a witness who told me that she thought the incident looked intentional. I was too much in a state of shock to contact the police, get the license plate, etc.\"\\n38712515,6810,Washington,DC,20017,Crash Description,Oncoming car failed to yield to me as I was traveling straight through intersection with a green light. May have been distracted. I slammed on my brakes to avoid being hit and flipped over my handlebars. Bystanders helped get me to the sidewalk and police and EMS responded. No police report taken and the driver did not stop to assist. I was taken to Howard University Hospital by ambulance.\\n38769178,6810,Bethesda,MD,20817,Crash Description,I stopped at the crosswalk and waited for the traffic. Traffic was moving reasonably slowly due to congestion. The first lane of cars nearest me stopped to let me cross. I started to cross and got hit by a car in the second lane because the driver coming in the second lane failed to register that a line of cars stopped at a crosswalk indicates that someone is crossing. It looked like the car was slowing to stop but it kept coming and its right fender clipped the back of my bike as I cycled through flipping me to the ground and wrecking my back wheel.\\n39499601,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was traveling southbound at dawn on 6th Street NW on my Gary Fisher Hoo Koo E Koo with front Urban 350 bike light on full brightness with my rear tail-light also blinking, wearing my helmet and gloves. I was traveling quickly down 6th Street, checking the traverse traffic on New York Ave so that I was going about 20-25mph passing into the intersection of New York Ave as the light turned green in my direction of travel. After turning my head both ways to double check and passing through the intersection, I noticed a black SUV turn left into a parking lot in front of me and into my direction of travel. I was about 20-30\\' away from the vehicle when I noticed it and couldn\\'t swerve or brake sufficiently in time to stop and slammed (T-boned) into the front passenger door, window, and frame (which separates the window between the front passenger and back passenger window). I braked hard on the front and likely hit the vehicle between 15-20mph with my back, shoulder, and left leg. The glass in the front passenger window broke and the both passenger doors were dented.\"\\n39596142,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"Van changed lanes without signaling into the parking lane which I occupied at the time.

Broke my wrist and was scraped up. He and his buddies helped me up, but quickly left. I can only guess after seeing the damage he caused, didn\\'t want to be liable. A lot has been said about bike vs car accidents, but increasingly pedestrians are not looking when entering roadways.\"\\n39936037,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,I was traveling South on 1st St. The car in front of me turned left and as I started to proceeded through the intersection the Mercedes which was traveling North bound turned in front of me. I did not have enough time to stop or even react. I crashed into the side of the car and ended up on the ground.\\n39994043,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"Riding my bike south bound on 6st street, NW south of R Street, NW -- traveled over several steel plates and one of the steel plates -- the steel plates were wet and had some slippery material on it that allowed the bike to slip out from under me sideways. There was no indication of the danger of falling until my bike slipped out and I hit the steel plate with the left side of my body. Helmet cracked as my head hit the ground, arm and shoulder hit the ground.

A large SUV tried to pass in my lane and hit my elbow and then handlebars with the outside mirror.\"\\n42015842,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"I got into a nasty scuffle last night with a driver while riding home in the dark. I was biking up Randolph (turning right from 10th) towards Georgia Avenue when a car came out of nowhere at high speed and passed me aggressively within about 6 inches. They had the windows downs and were yelling obscenities at me also. It scared the crap out of me so I stopped after they passed to get my phone out and I saw them slow down which was alarming as I thought they were going to get out of the car or back up to me. They proceeded up to the red light at Georgia and Randolph where they were stopped so I caught up to them and called out their license plate number and warned them that they would be in trouble, and the guy who was driving opened his door as if to come after me. I veered into the Wendy\\'s parking lot and saw a policeman on duty and asked him to quickly follow me to the car before the light turned green which he did. The passenger, a woman, got out of the car and started screaming at me more (same one who was yelling the obscenities while passing closely). The policeman went to the driver and listened to his story and told me to stand away from the car, so I did and proceeded to take photos of the license plate. Then backup came and there were eventually 4 policeman questioning me about how I was riding, specifically, how far to the right was I riding. And they kept coming back to that as if I was at fault for not riding far enough to the right of the road. Then they said that the law is that you have to ride far to the right, which I didn\\'t think was true and when I looked it up this morning, it turns out not to be true. So I pointed out a few times that one law that I DO know for sure is that drivers must give at least 3 feet between the car and the cyclist, to which they never even responded. They said they wouldn\\'t take a police report and said the whole conversation was being recorded and the driver left the scene without incident.\"\\n42032223,6810,Washington,DC,20005,Crash Description,\"I was cycling to the office and headed south in the 15th street bike sharrow. There were cyclists travelling in both directions and as I approached the traffic light at K street, a vehicle turned right without looking. I was unable to brake in time and slammed into the side of the vehicle. The police came and ticketed the driver of the van. I went to Urgent Care this afternoon due to the trauma to my left wrist - currently in a brace.\"\\n42152267,6810,Kensington,MD,20895,Crash Description,\"My bike hit a grate and caused a initial loss of control which I was able to recover from. The tire had a large gap but fortunately I was not injured. The issue is that the orientation and placement of the grate - it is on the right side of the road (where bikers are), at the bottom of a hill, and the drainage openings run PARALLEL to the road - a recipe for disaster.\"\\n42155695,6810,Washington,DC,20016,Crash Description,\"THIS WAS A NEAR CRASH- my bike hit ground, I landed on my feet, and neither hit the car. (Car made me crash my bike into the ground, damaging the brake levers slightly.) Car made illegal left turn traveling southbound on Mass Ave onto Garfield St eastbound without looking for people/bikes in crosswalk. I was on the eastern sidewalk heading downhill/southbound on Mass ave, had a walk signal, and was not especially looking for the car making a left because it\\'s illegal and rare that anyone attempts that turn. Car entered my field of vision as it was almost right in front of me in the crosswalk. I jammed on brakes on my 60lb cargo bike, traveling around 15mph. There was wet pavement, hindered my braking distance slightly because the bike tires skidded on the pavement and crosswalk paint. I ditched the bike and landed on my feet, bike hit ground and skidded to a stop. Neither I nor bike hit the car. The motorist stopped after the crosswalk- I don\\'t think she even noticed me until the bike hit the ground and I\\'m not sure she hit her brakes until after that. She was quite apologetic, asking if I was okay, etc. The damage to my bike was minor scrapes, adjustment screw stripped on one brake lever, and broken rear light bracket. I contemplated calling the cops so that they could cite her for the illegal left, but decided getting to work on time mattered more, and I and the bike were pretty much fine other than the light bracket. She offered money for the broken rear light, and gave me $40 cash. I took it and told her to never take an illegal left there again, and we both went on our ways.\"\\n42155740,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,I was traveling W on Mass Ave on my bike.

It was stopped in the street but with foot off the brake---no brake lights. My own inattention was the main cause of the crash, but it\\'s a drag to have cars parking in the bike lane. I went over the handlebars, bounced off the rear panel, and landed on my head/shoulder.\"\\n42178628,6810,Annandale,VA,22003,Crash Description,\"No crash, just a rather unsafe pass.

I expected him to yield, but instead he accelerated to cross and I crashed into his passenger door. A passing motorist stopped and called the police for us. The driver was a 16 year old on his way to high school, and was very apologetic.\"\\n42204012,6810,Bethesda,MD,20814,Crash Description,Hit from behind by right rear view mirror while merging into left lane to take left.\\n42204481,6810,McLean,VA,22101,Crash Description,\"As I was traveling from the Bluemont Bike Path to Fairfax Road, a Ford 250 construction trucks were staged in the Holiday Inn parking lot in rows, and was parked with its bumper up to the bike path, blocking visibility of traveling bikes and other trucks. I slowed as I passed the truck to stop before hitting the blind spot past the truck, but another truck was exiting the parking lot despite not being able to see bike or pedestrian traffic. I stopped in front to the truck but the truck was unable to stop. It hit me at low speed, pulling the bike under the bumper and sending me in the air. I landed hard on my back and helmet, and badly sprained my wrist. The impact crushed the front crank of my bike into the frame. I had flashing strobe lights on my helmet - forward, side markers and rear as well as a frame mounted strobe and had bright yellow reflective rain gear on. The lights remained flashing after the collision. Despite the risk created, the construction crew did not have a flag man and seemed unconcerned about the bike path until after the collision. They removed all trucks but the one which hit me before EMTs and police arrived. The policy noticed that I was no the bike path and had no stop sign and was rammed by the exiting truck. The police took reports and I went the hospital later that day. While the policy we taking their reports, the truck remained parked in the driveway, creating a new blind spot hazard.

My speed was about 18mph. I never heard or saw him coming. I was later told his speed was estimated at 35mph, and I don\\'t think he hit the brakes because I didn\\'t hear them. There was a sudden impact that threw me forward and over the handlebars onto the grass. My forehead hit the ground and I took a tumble, after which I carefully rolled onto my back. The driver stopped as did several witnesses. Someone was by my side quickly while others were calling EMS, medics and police arrived within minutes. I didn\\'t black out while paramedics ran through their protocols and got me into an ambulance. ER ran a bunch of tests and eventually sprung me loose that night. My bike is totaled, but I am lucky my injuries were minor. This crash happened on a straight, wide section of a two-lane road with great visibility in broad daylight. Several other vehicles had passed me with a comfortable buffer. I was on the right side of the lane (there is no shoulder) very focused on staying straight and stable because I was going pretty fast.

EMT personnel arrived first and the cyclist described the extent of the injuries. The police officer then arrived and listened to the cyclist\\'s brief verbal statement of what happened. The cyclist was then evaluated by EMT personnel and refused transport to a hospital. After receiving an evaluation from EMT staff, the police officer asked the cyclist to confirm that the cyclist was hit by the automobile as the automobile made a right hand turn. The cyclist confirmed. The officer gave cyclist his card with case number 12-033-0506. Cyclist heard the police officer tell the driver of the automobile that his opinion, which would be reflected in the police report, was that the driver was at fault. Cyclist was not aware of any citation that was awarded. Cyclist then asked the police officer if he needed any additional information, and the police officer said the cyclist was free to go.\"\\n42229897,6810,Washington,DC,20007,Crash Description,\"I was in the bike lane with a truck parked to my right. A car didn\\'t look and side swiped me while trying to get over into the parking lane. Luckily, the car mostly just hit my bike basket and slightly bent my back wheel. I didn\\'t get the driver\\'s contact info, which is my fault because I did make him pull over while I examined my bike (I didn\\'t notice the bent wheel at the time). But, I did get his license plate: 7RUM031, California.\"\\n42234491,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"A passenger getting out of an Uber car that was idle in the middle of the street (stopped for a red light) opened the door onto me on my left side. This was as I was biking south on 7th street NW, and had just left the intersection at Eye St. I fell into the car that was parked to my right side, my head struck that car. I was wearing a helmet. My hand was bleeding onto the sidewalk and I ended up getting 5 stitches on my hand.\"\\n42663129,6810,Arlington,VA,22203,Crash Description,\"A black Lincoln Navigator SUV made a left turn from 15th street directly across from the East side of the Washington Monument and hit the back of my bicycle while I was riding across the street at a crosswalk. (Specifically the front left driver\\'s side ran into the back left-side wheel of my bike). The traffic signal indicated I could cross. The most frightening part was that the vehicle apparently seemed to speed up when I was crossing. It likely was not intentional (probably trying to make a quick turn), but the driver did not seem to realize they had hit my bike until a few seconds after, then slowed but kept moving forward from the intersection. I looked inside the vehicle and could see the driver and a passenger, two asian males. The driver was approximately in his fifties or sixties with grey hair, dressed in a suit. There were plenty of people waiting to cross the street who saw the accident, (and probably heard me curse the driver); I was in such shock that when they asked if I was alright, I said \"\"yes,\"\" and jumped on my bike and rode forward about 25 feet to see if I could find someone from the National Park Police. I didn\\'t see any nearby, so I then hopped off to find a steady location to flip the bike upside down and check to see if it still was working. The bike seemed ok, with a couple of scratches. The spokes seemed ok but the wheel had friction against the brake pad. I looked up to see some of the accident witnesses looking at me while I checked my bike out. It was only at that moment that I realized it was a hit and run accident. I then got back onto my bike and rode back towards the intersection and then looked left onto Jefferson avenue. I could see several black vehicles. I rode up to the traffic signal at Jefferson and 14th and saw the Lincoln Navigator. I was able to look in the window and positively identify the driver and the second passenger and was a able to a get a photo of the License plates: LSS01, Virginia tags, March 14 expiry dates. I didn\\'t see any damage to the vehicle. I then crossed 14th street and walked my bike towards Constitution avenue. I realize now I should have stayed tried to get the driver to roll down his window but my body was in fight or flight mode, and the adrenaline was surging. I crossed Constitution avenue and then walked towards the Reagan building. I asked one of the building security guards if there was a police officer on site. They suggested I contact 911. I sat down on the fountain outside the building leaning my bike up against me and called the number. According to my cell phone call log the call was made at 5:36 pm. I filed a report with the Metropolitan police, who then told me to wait outside the building. I waited about 20 minutes for them to show, locking my bike up for a little bit while trying to calm down. I then decided to walk my bike down Pennsylvania Avenue towards the Old Post Office building, towards my destination of Ben and Jerry\\'s who were having a free ice cream cone day. I called my parents up to tell them what happened at 6:05 pm according to the log. When I got to the building I had a call from a 202 number. I answered the call and it was the Metro Police. I told them my current location and they showed up about 10 minutes later. I walked down to the curb and filed a report. I gave them the photo of the license plate number, and one officer ran it through the system. The officer came back and said they had no record of the tags, which they indicated was peculiar. Patrol Officer Zar Min (badge id?) #4829 gave me a case number of CCN 045904. I was told I would be able to find a report online.\"\\n42720896,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,I was heading eastbound in the travel lane and the driver sideswiped me.

My front wheel slid out from under me as I rolled over the wet section, and I fell heavily on my right side.\"\\n43277218,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"To note, there was no physical contact between me and the bus, but it was so close that I was left shaken, and I ride every day in DC, have booked across the country, and seen it all. While riding home tonight, in the middle of three lanes with the right lane reserved for parking, I was passed by a commuter bus traveling at full speed that came dangerously close to me. I was traveling in the middle of the lane in getting off a line of cars out of the light. I heard the bus approach, likely accelerating, and turn my head to see it pass me with one foot or less of clearance. As the front of the bus gets about 10 feet in front of me, I notice that it\\'s right tires are still very much in my lane. It never clears the lane fully, being always in both lanes while passing, before moving back in front of me. When it stopped at the next pickup location in front of circa foggy bottom, I noticed that the left front panel of the bus ( on the opposite side of the bus from my initial position, the side facing traffic coming the opposite direction) was not fully attached and the driver was pushing it back into place and out of traffic. I stopped in front of the bus and angrily growled that he nearly killed me, took a photo of the license plate and driver side of the windshield, and biked off still shaken.\"\\n43449570,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"Between Independence Avenue to G street SW, I was repeated honked at, tailgated and ultimately passed too closely. I was in the far right lane next to parked cars, not blocking or impeding traffic in any way since there was no traffic and the driver could easily pass me.\"\\n43458511,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I\\'m writing to report an assault, not a crash, in part because the incident was so truly disturbing to me. I was riding with my girlfriend back from dinner in Northern Virginia, and I was in the right lane on Penn, heading east. We decided that the best route was to turn north onto 25th to make our way up to Mt. Pleasant. I checked the lane to my left and saw that there was significant space before the next car and merged into the left-turn lane. However, as soon as I merged, I heard a car accelerating extremely quickly behind me. I checked back to my right and merged back into the right lane just in time for a Lexus sedan to blow past me on my left. Someone in the car yelled at me \"\"Get off the road!\"\" as they passed. I was quite upset, as I felt that a driver had (knowingly or not) threatened me with a few tons of accelerating steel for the offense of trying to share the road. My girlfriend and I have decided that we simply can\\'t ride in the District on Saturday nights. We have had far too many close calls with aggressive drivers, distracted drivers on cell phones, and drivers who have likely had a few drinks. It is a sad thing to say the least. I would love to see the District put \"\"share the road\"\" signs on the bridges and major roads into the district, as more often than not these cars have out-of-state plates. If you need anyone to help advocate for this, I would love to help.\"\\n44735997,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"I was biking in the far right lane, there was a red light at the intersection of 17 / U, and I was pulling up around the line of cars to get to the front of the intersection.

Did have to witnesses to the crash itself who offered names, numbers, emails.\"\\n45768033,6810,Washington,DC,20037,Crash Description,\"My husband was just hit (6:15p) by a cyclist. He was in the crosswalk at the intersection of 24th St and the I St Mall, heading east on foot. Cars were stopped at the stop signs at both the north and south sides of the intersection.

As I approached the intersection and was about to pass through the crosswalk, the light turned yellow. A car approaching from the opposite direction on Fleet Street put on their left turn signal from much farther back in the intersection, and upon noticing the light turning yellow, sped up and initiated their left turn from well behind the stop bar so as to make it through the light ahead of me. I swerved to avoid the car and went over the handlebars in the middle of the intersection. The driver did not stop (I assume because they didn\\'t see me fall in their rear view mirror), and no one else was present to witness the crash.\"\\n45965372,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was in the second lane from the right. The right lane was blocked by turning traffic. The Lexus was stopped waiting in the right lane. The car suddenly swerved in front of me. I was able to avoid most of the collision, but the front left fender of the car made contact with my right pedal. I kept my balance.

I continued through the intersection.\"\\n45979377,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"A woman in an SUV passed me on 21st street without the 3-foot-wide berth as mandated by DC regulations. The light was red, and she stopped about 30 feet in front of me. I passed her and let her know that she was driving too close, and when the light turned green, she passed by very closely again, striking my arm with the sideview mirror, causing it to bend back. I was unhurt, and my balance was not shaken. I did not fall. I tried to catch up to her at K street to get her license plate to possibly file a report, but I was unable to do so. I know it is a small infraction with no real consequences, but it leaves me feeling unsafe and very angry. To me, it is the equivalent of a person pointing a gun at me and not pulling the trigger. For the record: I am writing that I\\'d like follow up from WABA, but not particularly for this incident. I\\'d like information on how to join WABA (you all are certainly worth the membership price, considering the help and support you\\'ve already provided me, a non-member) and also advice on how to properly act in situations like this (it\\'s happened a few times in the past year) to maximize my own personal safety and consequences for offenders.

I got about half the way across the three west bound lanes and the light must have changed. An SUV started forward and hit me with it\\'s right front fender. The bike went down, but I jumped off and landed on my feet. My left leg was struck on the side and is swollen and sore. Another bruise is present on the medial right knee where the bike top bar hit my leg. Nothing else is injured. Police and an ambulance came. A report was made and my vital signs taken. As the policeman gave me the form he stated that I was at fault, as I did not know if the pedestrian light was blinking. My friend with me was upset by this. When he spoke up the policeman threatened to give me a citation. Please advice me of the law.

This happened mid-block and the driver crossed over the double lines, attempting to cross through both lanes of the bike lane. I was immediately to his left and was struck by the passenger door with no opportunity to evade. I managed to lock up my brakes and tuck my shoulder into his door to avoid coming off my bike. My shoulder and handle bar took the bulk of the impact and I remained upright. No scrapes or bruising immediately apparent and the bicycle suffered no apparent damage.

The driver passed most of the riders and then veered right, splitting the line near the front. I was the lead rider in the group that wound up behind his car. The driver then braked suddenly. I attempted to brake hard and veered left. I clipped the left-rear corner of the car, hit my chin on the edge of the trunk, and flipped over, landing on my rear in the opposite lane. A few other riders wound up in the grass on either side of the road. The driver then sped off.. It turned out he lived a half-mile down the road, Some riders followed him there, where he parked in his garage and remained inside. An ambulance and police arrived about 15 minutes later. I declined to go to the hospital in spite of a large welt on my chin from the collision. The police left the scene without interviewing me.

I did not see anyone in the back seat, and since the driver had pulled left, I assumed he was picking up a fare from the median to my left. Additionally, ahead to the right was a clear space along the curb for a building entrance, and the cab could have easily pulled into it if he needed to unload from the right, so in that instant I figured he was looking for something on the left of the cab. There was now a 6 foot gap between the cars parked on the right, and the cab parked on the left, and I proceeded to pass the cab on his right side. When I was at about the rear bumper of the cab, I saw the door start to open, and a head pop up from the back seat (I think he was bent over picking up his briefcase when I first looked in the back window). I hit the brakes hard and pulled as far to the right as possible, but the open door only left 2 feet of space, and ended up crashing my left hand into the coping of the door, hitting the right side of my handlebars on the parked car on my right, and flying over the door onto the parked car to the right, denting it badly, and sort of half landing on the open door and ground. I was wearing a helmet, but was very rattled, and was transported to the hospital. My bike incurred $350 in damage. I was insured, so my copay was only $100, but the hospital bill was $1600, and I had about a 3 week recovery from bruises and abrasions. I started attempting to collect from the taxi\\'s insurance, but after talking to several people I considered experts, I concluded that even though the taxi was at fault, pursuing a case was not likely to net compensation commensurate with my injuries or the time it would take to pursue the case.\"\\n47562401,6810,Mount Rainier,MD,20712,Crash Description,\"Traveling North on the MBT 8th street sharrows, 3100 block, a 4 door sedan began to tailgate my neighbor (Evan Wilder) and me, aggressively honking.

I was sent over the handlebars and car, hitting the ground including with my helmet. Mr. Sheikh stopped, said let\\'s not call police, I\\'ll drive you home (all the way to COlumbia, MD). In my adrenaline rushed state, I agreed; in retrospect, I wasn\\'t thinking clearly due to the accident.

I attempted to swerve but struck the door with my right hip, then jackknifed the bike and struck the ground with my left hand and right arm. I rolled as I hit the street.\"\\n47827110,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was riding in the bike lane on Columbia Rd. The car I collided with began opening their door when I was within 10 feet of passing them, or less than one second between initiating the door-opening and the door collision. I began to turn to away from the door, but there wasn\\'t enough time for me to get out of the way. They clipped my right handle bar, stopping my bike and flipping me over. I bashed my knee and jerked my head. One day later, my knee is sore and my neck is very sore.\"\\n47892548,6810,West Hollywood,CA,90069,Crash Description,\"I was riding in the Northwest direction on Massachusetts Avenue at 6:15 PM on Wednesday, 6/15. There was heavy traffic and I was riding on the shoulder (there are two lanes of traffic in the Northwest and not a good bike lane. I turn right on 5th and ride North with the bike lane). An SUV in the stop and go traffic opened it\\'s passenger door without signaling, pulling over, or putting on hazard lights. I hit my brake and went over my handlebars, hitting the car door with my shoulder. The passenger was very apologetic and asked repeatedly if I was alright. I was relatively unscathed except for a bruised collarbone.\"\\n47915751,6810,Falls Church,VA,22042,Crash Description,\\n47956645,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,Crash Test\\n47963884,6810,Washington,DC,20036,Crash Description,\"Traveling southbound on 15th St NW in the protected bike lane, I approached the intersection with M Street. Traffic signal was green with ~13 seconds left on the pedestrian timer. Two cars from the car lanes made a right turn across the PBL onto M Street. The first car had plenty of clearance to make it through the intersection without any worry about bicycles. The second car (a silver Mercedes sedan) followed behind the first car very closely, without enough time to safely clear bicycle traffic in the PBL. I anticipated this second car and thus braked, but was unable to brake enough to come to a complete stop. My bike collided with the car at approximately the right-rear tire. I flipped around my bike, and the bike scratched the car\\'s paint.\"\\n47964677,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was traveling East in the bike lanes on my way home. As I crossed 10th street, a red passenger car attempted to make an illegal U Turn in the middle of Pennsylvania Ave NW and hit me with his driver side door.

I was dazed and disoriented as the driver paused long enough to roll down his window, ask me several times if I was okay, said he didn\\'t see me (duh) and then left the scene.\"\\n47966595,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"biked southbound on 11th street, door opened only 10 inches right as I passed, hooked handlebar and crashed to ground.\"\\n48075361,6810,Centreville,VA,20120,Crash Description,I was cycling straight on dry mill road back towards leesburg. As i approached T intersection (woodburn road was on my right and ends at dry mill) vehicle was travelling on dry mill in opposite direction and proceeded to make Left turn onto woodburn as i came through intersection. I crashed into passenger side doors with my bike and right side of body. Vehicle stopped; EMS was called and i had multiple injuries.\\n48085262,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"I was traveling to the right of traffic Westbound in the 1300 block of Columbia Rd NW. I was initially passed by cars going in the same direction on that block, but they slowed as traffic ahead was just starting to move from the light at 14th and Columbia turning from red to green. Still on my line, I passed some of those cars as they were beginning to pick up speed. One veered across my path - in the middle of the block - probably to move front-first into a parking spot on the right hand side of the street. I yelled at the driver, but he didn\\'t stop in time and I was unable to avoid the sideswipe.\"\\n48085968,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"Passenger exited a cab from the rear right door of the main lane as I was passing on the right in the wide opening between the car lane and the parked cars. I slammed into the opening door and wedged between it and the parked car on the right. Bent my handle bar, jacked up my front break, and I took the brunt of the impact on the handle bars and left shoulder leading into the wide cab door. This was when approaching the red light at 14th st. on P, in front of the whole foods. That stretch is a death gauntlet of exiting, entering, distracted driving, and cabs.\"\\n48233822,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I was on bike headed westbound on Massachusetts Avenue NW between 5th ST NW and 6th ST NW at approx 19:00, when a red and silver taxi cab, going eastbound, made a mid-block u-turn to go westbound on Massachusetts. Upon making the u-turn, the driver nearly hit me. I notified him verbally that I was there and he yelled something at me as he lunged his car forward towards me. I moved out of his way, in front of him on Massachusetts Ave and proceeded to turn left on to 6th St NW. I was then in the rightmost southbound lane on 6th, as he followed behind me, then suddenly passed me closely on my left, cut closely in front of me and slammed on his brakes. I grabbed my brakes as hard as possible, but could not stop fast enough as he was approx 2 feet in front of me. As a result of his stopping short in the middle of the road, I was thrown on to his trunk. At this point he nailed the gas, throwing me off of the car, and sped away. I followed him southbound on 6th St NW to get his license plate number (DC tag: H-96494), down to Pennsylvania Ave, where he then ran the red light. I turned right on Penn and was waiting on the SE corner of Penn and 7th NW, when he approached headed northbound on 7th. I asked him to stop so we could call the police and was off my bike and in the crosswalk with the right of way when he again lunged his car forward at me. I moved out of the way, as he put his car in reverse, did a u-turn and then turn from 7th southbound on to Constitution westbound. I then called 911, but when the officers arrived they told me that I was at fault for hitting the taxi, and told me that I would get a ticket for doing so. I felt intimidated and did not file a report at that time. The next morning, 10/14/15, I went to the 1D substation and filed a report, #163120.\"\\n48262904,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was biking in the right-hand lane, passing a parked car, when a woman in the parked car opened her drivers side door on me, hitting my bike and causing me to crash in the lane. My back tire came off and the rim was twisted, and I sustained a large contusion on my right hip and whiplash for which I later went to the hospital.\"\\n48283409,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"Taxi stopped in the turning lane on K street and I was doored as I attempted to pass on the taxi\\'s right (between the cab and the parked car). Very much my fault and a foolish mistake. Luckily, I was passing cautiously and only travelling about 8 mph. I would really appreciate knowing what resources are available describing/mapping types of cycling accidents. Knowing the most common locations in Washington for accidents could be very useful.\"\\n48304613,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,Traveling southwest on Arkansas on the right side of the lane of traffic. A motorist headed the same direction on Arkansas turned right onto Webster and hooked me. I flew over my handlebars and hit the ground with my right shoulder. The motorist had to back her car up because she ran over my bicycle wheel. There was damage to her front-right quarter panel. My front wheel is taco\\'d and there are a good number of scratches on the bike.\\n48305610,6810,Silver Spring,MD,20901,Crash Description,\"I was biking on 13th St on my way home to Silver Spring, in heavy rush hour traffic, at dusk. Coming down the hill from Columbia Heights I was coasting in between parked cars on my right and bumper to bumper traffic on my left, going approx 20 mph. All of sudden, near the bottom of the hill, a car door swung open and I impacted the door head on. Next thing I knew I was lying on the pavement, stunned, with the wind knocked out of me. The woman driving, Noelle Melton, got out of her car, and was appropriately mortified. She said she was a former cyclist and usually looks, but was distracted by her kids in the back seat. She helped me up, and since we were right in front of her house, got water and an ice pack. The driver in the car on 13th St, who saw the entire accident, got out to check on me, but I didn\\'t get his name. I assured everyone that I was okay, but had gotten to wind knocked out of me. After 20 minutes, and checking to make sure my bike was rideable, I rode the remaining 6 miles home.\"\\n48350866,6810,Washington,DC,20008,Crash Description,\"\"\"Out of service\"\" bus was sitting by the bus stop. I signaled to the car in the left lane that was about 100 feet away that I would be going around the bus. The driver made eye contact but as I went around bus on left proceeded to keep going and side swiped me. I could not veer right because the bus was parked there. After car moved ahead I fell hard on my left side (elbow, arm, hip). The car did not stop and I was unable to get the plate # as my focus was to get off the road. The car behind me opened the window and asked if I was okay. Walked to sidewalk. Bike unharmed.\"\\n48362927,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was cycling down Rhode Island avenue as a parked SUV doored me. The door slammed into my side and I was thrown into the middle of the road. Luckily, there was no traffic at that moment. There are three car lanes on Rhode Island and I had been cycling in the lane furthest to the right, in the space between the parked car and the middle lane. The police officer issued me a ticket for \"\"riding abreast\"\" because she said I should have been in the middle lane, out of reach of the parked car\\'s door. There is a dent in the driver\\'s SUV door from my impact.\"\\n48367168,6810,San Francisco,CA,94110,Crash Description,\"I was crossing K St and had the green light. A car going the other way ran the red and did a uturn in the intersection--when I was caught in their headlights I was confused and thought they might have been coming at me, so I moved to my right to try to avoid them. Unfortunately, I had a gym bag hanging from my handlebars and it got caught in my wheel and threw me over the handlebars onto my shoulder. The car paused and said \"\"Are you ok\"\" and then sped off.\"\\n48372285,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was westbound on Van Buren Street NW, between 13th and 14th Street NW. I was coming down a slight hill and I saw the driver on the street coming eastbound toward me. I had assumed he was continuing straight up the hill as he didn\\'t have any signals on to indicate otherwise. I was about 15 feet away from the car, when turned left in front of me. I did not have time to brake or swerve and hit the front of his car, rolled across the hood, and then landed on the sidewalk about 15-20 feet away.\"\\n48404840,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was heading south bound in the bike lane on 14th street. There was lots of car traffic, and that lane was moving very slow, but the bike lane was clear. I remember glancing at my bike computer as I passed the Subway and was going around 10-12mph. There was a green light, so even though the cars weren’t moving much, I was able to get through the intersection with a clear lane ahead of me. Immediately after I passed through the intersection, the honda cut across the bike lane in an attempt to take the last parking spot before Park on that side of the street. She didn’t look to see if there was any oncoming bike traffic. I realized she was jumping right into my path, and I couldn’t get out of the way fast enough. I tried to swerve to the right, and impacted with the back right corner/right side of her car, mostly with my left shoulder, my head hitting and shattering the windshield before I fell to the ground. I\\'m pretty sure my garmin watch helped protect my wrist. I ended up sitting down with my knees bent, leaning backwards on my hands, slightly dazed. A couple in their late 20s to mid 30s helped me up, picked up my bike. An older man called 911. I got up and immediately asked the driver something along the lines of “what the hell?!” She responded that she hadn’t seen me. I called my boyfriend at 11:19 am and calmly told him I’d been hit. The pedestrians moved my bike over to the bench, the couple swiveled the handle bars around so the bike was in line again, since the fall had rotated the front tire almost a 180. I took off my helmet and sat on the bench and waited for the paramedics. I was taken to Howard hospital, where they ignored my dizziness and light headed ness but did xray my elbow and knees. I have retained Bruce Deming to help me with this. My Dolce Specialized sustained minor damage; most notably, I need new handlebars and a new helmet. I checked NO about receiving compensation because I haven\\'t yet, although I expect to. I checked YES about a follow up simply because i\\'m more than happy to answer additional questions or clarify anything I\\'ve written here if need be.\"\\n48405406,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,As I was riding parallel to traffic a passenger riding in an uber opened his car door into me.

As I approached the intersection with P Street, a vehicle attempted to begin to turn right across the bike lane without looking over shoulder. The vehicle struck me and when the driver realized slammed on the brakes. My bicycle struck her sideview mirror causes some damage to my bicycle. Note that the she admitted wrong doing, indicated she didn\\'t signal because she made a quick decision to turn onto P Street to avoid traffic.\"\\n48537853,6810,Washington,DC,20005,Crash Description,\"I was heading south on 14th street towards logan circle. There was no bike lane, and I was riding as close to the right hand curb as possible (there were cars parked along 14th street). There were other vehicles also traveling south on 14th street and they were on my left hand side. As I approached the intersection (maybe 6 or 8 feet away) between 14th and V Street, the van that was to my left suddenly moved infront of my path to turn right onto V Street. It was too late for me to stop so I ended up colliding with the van. I made contact with the van on my left handle bar first. I was pushed over to the right and I landed on my right cheek followed by my right shoulder, elbow, and knee. There were two men that were standing on the corner that saw the whole thing, but i didn\\'t get their name. The van that hit me was a DC metro police van. It was driven by a police (a woman, I didn\\'t get her name) and there were like 4 other policemen in the car. they called for an ambulance to check me out and a sargent was called to the scene to take my statement. later a crime scene guy came and took my statement again, along with photos of my injuries. I was on the scene for about 90 minutes in all.

I was in the middle lane, and was about to signal to go to the left lane to make a left turn. I was going with the (fairly slow) speed of traffic on a Bikeshare bike. The black coupe accelerated into me. I was towards the right side of the lane, and after the car hit me, I veered across the curb lane and crashed into the sidewalk.

The driver then drove off while I was still on the pavement. Five days later, the same truck, this time driven by the passenger of the first incident, drove across the road while accelerating, in an attempt to at least intimidate me. She came within two feet of killing me.\"\\n48653973,6810,Chevy Chase,MD,20815,Crash Description,\"I was biking in the right lane. The car sped close to me honking his horn just south of Tilden. When we both stopped at Porter he rolled down his window and yelled derogatory insults and sped off. I wasn\\'t aware of anything I could have done wrong - I almost wonder if he mistook me for someone else. I tried to report this to 311 per the instructions on the DC Smooth Operator website (http://www.smoothoperatorprogram.com/about.html) but they wouldn\\'t take my report, transferred me to 911, and the operator at 911 didn\\'t know how to take the report either. Basically the Smooth Operator program is useless as far as I can tell.\"\\n48842979,6810,Bethesda,MD,20817,Crash Description,\"I was on the bikepath/sidewalk going east on Democracy Blvd on the bridge over Route 270. At the east end of the bridge, the narrow sidewalk was blocked by a tripod holding an orange diamond-shaped sign saying “Uneven Pavement.” I had to dismount, move my bike over a high curb and onto the grooved pavement. I decided to ride a few yards and then turn back onto the bike path at the next curb cut. But when I tried to turn off the grooved pavement, there was a 2-inch step up onto the ungrooved pavement and my bike tire would not go over this high step and I fell. No motor vehicles were involved.\"\\n49154710,6810,Alexandria,VA,22304,Crash Description,I was heading east down the hill on King Street. The car turned right onto Upland right in front of me.\\n49173169,6810,Alexandria,VA,22306,Crash Description,\"Again, there was no crash. Basically the crosswalk turned on and I began to cross the street on my bicycle. A car pulled in front blocking the crosswalk to turn right onto I Street thereby blocking the cycletrack as they had to stop for pedestrians crossing from Metro Station. That car found a small spot to squeeze through and so I continued across the intersection. I was maybe 1/2-2/3 through at this point when a white caddilac escalade pulled in front quickly and also stopped very quickly just barely avoiding hitting a pedestrian. He, too, was blocking the crosswalk. This time I had the choice of cutting left and hitting pedestrians, cutting right directly into oncoming traffic or trying my best to stop. I slammed my brakes and turned slgihtly right. I was able to stop, but I slid off my saddle and to stop from falling onto the escalade I put my left gloved hand up onto the back window portion of the escalade. The bike never touched the car and about 5-10 seconds or so later I remounted the bike and continued on my way. The driver never rolled down his window to apologize or say a word and the windows were tinted so I couldn\\'t tell anything beyond that although I was expecting at least an apology since I was in the right of way. I chalked it up to just unfortunate luck and continued along my way. About 20-30 feet later I found myself on the ground with my bike strewn about my legs with a man screaming \\'you touched my fucking car.\\' I was pretty dazed since I did not expect to be tackled in broad daylight on a bike and as I started to look around I noticed two DC Police squad cars across the street. I waited about 15-20 seconds and only responded to the man to get the hell off me and I didn\\'t hit his damn car and then repeated get the hell off me. The cops came over and asked what happened and I explained that he tackled me. The guy responded \"\"damn right I tackled you, you touched my fucking car\"\" and the cops turned toward him repeating \"\"sir, did you just say you tackled him?\"\" Russell responded \"\"Yes\"\" and they said, \"\"tackled?\"\" and he said yes again. They then proceeded to take us down to the corner where Russell claims I hit his car and they take our licenses. They asked if I was injured and I said I\\'m not a physician, but from what I could gather my knee was a little scraped up and my hand felt bruised. (I wrote down the sequence of events in a word document the day of if that\\'s any help in your reporting processes). Anyway, the cop asked if I planned to file assault charges and I said I\\'m not sure, but I don\\'t have to decide right now, right? The main cop turned to his partner and said call an ambulance. Said cop and his partner start discussing in front of me that if they call an ambulance then they have to file a report. The main cop told his partner to call in the ambulance (no ambulance ever came). The same main the cop started off by explaining that technically I could be considered hitting and running the vehicle for having placed my gloved hand onto it to avoid a collission and technically Russell could be portrayed as detaining me until the police arrived. They said and technically Russell could be considered assaulting me for tackling me. He explained how under the law they could technically arrest both of us. At that moment I took out my phone and started recording the officer\\'s names and badge numbers. I told the officer that I did not agree with his assessment as I never hit the vehicle therefore there was no hit and run, I was paused for a good 5-10 seconds to remount and wait to safely move around the vehicle and the driver said nothing, that the driver didn\\'t attempt to communicate to me at any point until after he tackled me and that the cops were literally 20 feet away so how on earth would he claim he was detaining me for them? The cop said something back about not seeing the tackle, but hearing the guy yelling at me. I said, \\'yes, you didn\\'t see him tackling me because he didn\\'t start yelling until after he tackled me otherwise you would have seen him tackle me from where you guys were parked.\"\" The cop backtracked some saying he was speaking theoretically and did not intend to arrest/charge/etc me (I had limited experience with the law in this regard as I spent 07-early 11 working for a member of a state legislature who sits on a judicial committee). At this point other cops had come including two who were much friendly. These cops both explained that they owned/rode bikes and they were discussing bike riding with me as the original cops took Russell aside to listen to him and inspect his vehicle. One of these cops with me said he looked at Russell\\'s car and it was clear I didn\\'t hit it at all. I asked him if I should take photos and he said by all means I should because I should protect myself. The same cop said \\'im not a mechanic, but to me there is no visible damage at all and I would speculate that you did not hit him so if you need me in court, I would testify t that.\"\" The same nice cop then explained how he would have handled it all differently, but he wasn\\'t first on scene. The other nice cop explained to a Sgt who had arrived what happened. It seemed the cops who didn\\'t have cycling experience at all didn\\'t understand the sliding off the saddle forward when breaking hard, but the nice cop who did ride, was able to pretty easily show them and also explain how had there been a collission what sort of marks would have been there. Unfortunately the two nice cops got called away to some disturbance over oatmeal at the Occupy Wall Street folks across the street. The original cop proceeded to say he was filing a 1050 without explaining much of what it was. He gave my identification back and Russell\\'s identification back. They said the report would be available within a week or two at their headquarters. He gave me a torn off piece of paper with his information (Office James Spencer), contact info for station, a report number \\'Con: 164.839\\', date, time and location). On Thursday, I walked to the 3rd District HQ address Officer Spencer (main cop referred to above) provided me as I planned to file assault charges and the duty officer told me she can\\'t tell what\\'s in the 1050 until it is formally submitted. She explained that the assault charges could be contained within the report or they may not be and that Officer Spencer wasn\\'t there. I plan to call the station tomorrow to see if the report is available for me and if so, then I plan to inspect to see if they included the assault charges otherwise I plan to file the misdemeanor assault charge against the guy.\"\\n49291723,6810,Arlington,VA,22206,Crash Description,\"I pushed the alert cross button, all the lights were in working order, upon arrival to the cross walk at S Shirlington/S Arlington Mill Dr (this connects to the bike path). As I passed through the first two lanes of the cross walk, I stopped at the median to ensure on coming traffic would indeed stop. However, a sedan was going fast and apparently did not see or acknowledge the flashing lights. I made eye contact and pointed across to the lights and cross walk. The car then came to an abrupt halt followed by a back end crash by a close following truck followed by yet another back end crash into the truck by a station wagon. Everyone appeared to be unhurt. An Arlington motorcycle policeman was immediately on the spot and seemed have witnessed the incident. I asked if he wished to have my statement but he said I could leave without delay. I left the scene. I felt badly for the guy in the sedan how, although going fast, attempted to do the right thing by stopping for me but just a little too late and abruptly for those following too close to react. From my vanatage point, many drivers cannot see or are late to notice the crosswalk. Perhaps the lights need to be more intense and drivers should proceed down S Shirlington at a slower speed as come down off the exit from 395.\"\\n49353810,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"wife “almost home” The light for outbound (EB) New York Ave traffic turned red. I checked to make sure cars approaching the intersection in the EB direction were coming to a stop. They were. I checked to make sure no cars were coming from O Street NE (where there is a new structured parking lot that has increased car traffic coming out of O Street NE) into the intersection. There were no cars coming from O Street. I pedaled across the street on my bike through the crosswalk. I passed the first two of the three outbound lanes. I then looked toward the inbound lanes to make sure I could continue across New York Avenue. When I got to the third of three outbound lanes, my bike was struck by a car. I did not see the car hit me as I was looking to the right, and the car hit me from the left. I was thrown back and to the ground. I jumped up, watched a silver sedan continue out New York Avenue, run the red light (which has a camera) at New York and Florida Ave NE, and turned to the 3 pedestrians on the NW corner of New York Avenue to ask them if they got the license plate number of that car. They said no, and helped me pick up my bike, glasses that had been thrown off, and bags. One pedestrian stayed and left her information with my wife. She was walking two small dogs and I think her name was Laura. She said she lives in one of the NoMa apartment buildings. My wife has since lost the contact information. She left before the police came. I’ve never felt a force as great as that. I think the car was traveling at a speed of at least 40 MPH, based on that feeling and how quickly the car seemed to be moving when I was able to look up and watch it continue driving away. I texted my wife at 7:30 PM telling her that I was hit by a car and to come get me I called 911 and an ambulance and fire truck came within 10 minutes. They checked me out for injuries or concussions, cleaned my wounds, and recommended that I go to the hospital. My injuries: • Large swollen contusion on right calf with significant bruising. • Open wound on left elbow that was bleeding significantly. • Bruised right ribs • Major bruising on left hamstring • Major bruise on upper right buttock. • Road rash out outer right forearm • Bruising on left forearm. • Road rash on left upper back with open wound. • Road rash on right shoulder with open wound. • While I don’t remember whether I hit my head or not, the helmet has road abrasion marks in the area above my right temple. I went to Urgent Care, had my injuries examined, and was given pain medication. My recently purchased (2/8/17) All City Space Horse bike has a dent in the top bar in the other direction from the point of impact, indicating that it absorbed such huge force that it is probably destroyed. While I realize that I am very fortunate that I was not hurt worse or killed, I do not think that my good luck should result in this investigation being given a low priority. This person ran a clear red light and then ran from the scene. The red light camera should identify the car. There may be surveillance video from ATF, Wendys, or McDonalds that could help identify the car and the driver.\"\\n49691951,6810,Washington,DC,20008,Crash Description,\"I was riding north on 7th when, at the intersection of M, I was left-hooked. I was riding on the street between traffic in my direction and parked cars, and swerved to my left to try to avoid the car, which then hit me on my left side, throwing me in the air. I landed on the hood and bounced to the street, landing face down. Besides wanting to contribute to your data gathering efforts, my main reason for submitting this information is that I\\'m interested in finding out whether I have any recourse to what I see as a troubling aspect of this incident. The driver, either lying or mistaken, told the police that I was riding on the sidewalk and rode into the crosswalk in front of him, while I told the officer that I was riding on the street and had the green light, which, in lieu of a full third party account, seems to have tied the officer\\'s hands when it came to making a determination of blame. Neither the driver nor I were cited.\"\\n49720667,6810,annandale,VA,22003,Crash Description,The driver was looking to the left to see if any traffic was coming. Her light was red. I stopped at the crosswalk and looked to make sure all was stopped and safe for my perfectly legal and safe crossing. The driver moderately accelerated into the lane and hit me as I crossed the space/ I went down and watched my bike right in front of me get crunched and ground into the pavement. Then she kept moving toward my head. Stressful. An ambulance was called but refused. Nothing was broken. But she was faulted.

Driver speed through traffic and passed all other cars and bikes and came to stop at red light at 24th. I then came to a stop at the cross walk of the same intersection. At green light rode into Washington Circle in outside lane, merging into outside lane of Washington Circle. Driver sped around and passed me in inside lane of circle then swerved through my lane in front of me to turn right on 23rd. Driver stopped abruptly in my lane to avoid hitting another cyclist already in the lane. At this time I was unable to stop and ran into the back of the car. No injuries and no apparent damage to the vehicle. Driver sped away, turning south onto 23rd.\"\\n50678689,6810,Washington,DC,20016,Crash Description,\\n50686832,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"I was traveling through an intersection, leading a group of cars. We had a green turn arrow to make a left-hand turn. As I began turning, a car approaching from in front of me went through his red light (without stopping, slowing or signaling) trying to make a right turn onto the same street. The driver claimed he did not see me. My best guess is that he was trying to sneak in before the cars behind me made the turn. Whatever the case, he broke several laws. Other important info: - I was wearing a helmet - I obeyed all laws - I signaled with my arm indicting a left turn - The driver seemed perturbed rather than remorseful - The driver lied about the incident saying he had a green light - The police report clearly states that the driver was in the wrong\"\\n50759799,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"Biking up 8th St NE (on street shared portion of Met Branch trail) As I came up to the Monroe St NE intersection, there was a car infront of me, it took a right turn when intersection was cleared and I followed. I looked to the left and saw a car on the East bound lane on Monroe street that started to slow down, I looked to the right at the west bound lane and caught a glimpse of a car that was still far away. I proceeded to cross the intersection, looked again to the left to acknowledge the car that stopped, by the time I looked to my right, the east bound car was already passing at a pretty high speed and did not stop. I hit the passenger side of the car with my left shin first, swerved, hit it again on my left side, spun 180 degrees of the bike and landed on my left side. The car stopped a few feet after the intersection. Someone made the 911 call and police and ambulance were there within minutes. Several things are completely wrong with that intersection. Aside from there needing to be a stop sign there, there is no crosswalk on the east side of the intersection where bikes would be crossing to get back on the MBT. The west side has a crosswalk and a pedestrian stop sign post on the yellow lane divider. This area is quickly becoming a commercial strip with a lot of ped/ bike traffic and there needs to be at the very least a stop sign if not a stop light. The other thing that makes it so dangerous is that the all incoming traffic on both Monroe and 8th are coming from lower grades and are completely blind until they reach the intersection.\"\\n50764776,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"Driver was aggressive towards motorists on the street, first passed me by too closely when I was in the New York Avenue bike lane between 13th and 14th Street, then honked loudly twice while I was on New York Avenue and gunned the engine. There was another person in the cab too. DC Transport rep who was directing traffic also saw the garbage truck be aggressive, as did another driver. When I tried taking a picture at the red light the garbage truck turned quickly on 15th Street.\"\\n50910496,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was riding in the bike lanes just in front of City Hall on Pennsylvania Avenue, near 13th St. and a taxi came from behind me, swerved into the bike lanes to make a U-turn and knocked me off my bike.\"\\n50950846,6810,Takoma Park,MD,20912,Crash Description,\"I was traveling south on 7th street, and was going straight through a green light. The BMW began turning as I entered the intersection. I attempted to brake, but as I was traveling downhill and roads were slick from the just-beginning rain, I could not brake in time. The impact occurred near the front right headlight of the vehicle. I was knocked over, along with my bike. The car stopped, and the driver got out and apologized. An onlooker ran to my aid and helped me and my bike up.\"\\n51032969,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,The cyclist (and his three year old child in a child seat) were biking west using the bike lanes on Pennslvania Ave when the cab made an illegal U-turn across the bike lane causing a collision between the cab and the bicycle.\\n51046209,6810,Arlington,VA,22209,Crash Description,\"I was wearing a helmet and a bright yellow Pearl Izumi bike jacket. I was southbound on 18th st, and was a block or two south of where the bike lane ends and it becomes single lane. I am not used to being passed there. Because I was riding in the right hand side of the lane, a vehicle passed me, possibly several vehicles. A red and tan pickup truck passed me, very close, which severely startled me because he was maybe eight inches from my left thing. When I saw the rear of the vehicle clear the front of my bike, I started to slow down to get out of the road. What I did not realize was that he was pulling a trailer. It struck the back of my bike, knocking me off. My right leg was then bashed by something, which may have been the axle guard metal on the rear axle of the truck\\'s trailer. I was dazed and on the side of the road. The truck stopped, which caused traffic to stop completely. The driver was concerned. Because I was confused and in shock (and also realizing that I could have been killed), I may have said something like \"\"I shouldn\\'t have been that close to you\"\". I know that I did indicate to the driver of the vehicle that I wanted his insurance information. In hindsight I realize it was entirely the fault of the passing vehicle. The person operating the truck behind the vehicle that hit me became agitated and started screaming at the truck driver to move his vehicle. The driver of the vehicle that hit me responded with \"\"this man is hurt, give him some time, relax!\"\" Someone gave me some water. I elevated my injured leg on a construction signpost and lay on the concrete. Fire dept responded first, then police, than an ambulance. I was loaded into the ambulance. Officer Balcazar, A (badge #2042) from the Third District DC PD took my statement as well as several witness statements. When I was secured in the ambulance, he told me that based on witness statements I was \"\"riding abreast\"\" of the vehicle and gave me a citation for $25. I spoke to a lawyer yesterday who told me to fight the ticket, and that if I feel that I have any serious injuries they can represent me. I do not yet know if that will be the case; I have some numbness and tingling in the affected leg, but that may just be bruising and inflammation, I will not know for some days/weeks. The lawyer told me that if I do not have any lasting injuries, and given that my bike appears undamaged and I have medical insurance, it is unlikely to be worth pursuing.\"\\n51068582,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"Car (a small SUV) was stopped at the red light coming down from 14th st bridge. There is a \\'no turn on red\\' sign. I was on the sidewalk bicycle trail along Maine Ave, I had green light on the pedestrian crossing, so I started to cross. The driver didn\\'t see me - I think she only looked the other way as the vehicle traffic is one-way on Maine there, whereas bikes are 2-way - and ignored the \\'no turn on red\\' sign, she went ahead and ploughed directly into me, front of her car hit side of my bike full on. At very low speed, but a heavy vehicle. I was fine, the bike was a write off.\"\\n51094699,6810,Chevy Chase,MD,20815,Crash Description,I was passing two stopped vehicles which were in the right lane and a large SUV passed me on the left close enough to graze me and knock me off the bike.\\n51102625,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I checked to see if i could cross Washington Ave , looked at walk signal and said 11 seconds so i proceeded. Unfortunately there are two signals the one i needed was to the right of the crosswalk on an island with bright sunshine ruining visibility.

I landed on the hood, then fell to the ground. I was wearing a helmet. He got out of the cab and immediately blamed me for going too fast and not having lights (not true). He helped me get my bike from under his car. It *appeared* ok, but the chain was derailed. He asked if I needed an ambulance. When I said no, he got into his car and left. Someone had called the ambulance, and they arrived with the police. I had to sign a \"\"refusal of medical treatment\"\" from them, but I didn\\'t file a report because the (nice) cop said it wouldn\\'t lead anywhere. I didn\\'t get any ID from the driver. He was 5\\'5\"\" or 5\\'7\"\", dark-skinned with dark hair and mustache. His taxi was a dark color, brown. I don\\'t remember anything beyond that.\"\\n51216692,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"Car suddenly stopped in intersection- biker unable to break hard enough to stop (intersection is a two way stop for the driver, not for traffic going north and south bound.

Leaving Clermont Dr there were no cars on Franconia Rd. Short time later I heard the large truck honking its horn, two cars buzz me, both passed way too close. The truck now directly behind me keeps honking its horn. As the road starts to widen the truck too buzzes me coming way to close, the trailer came so close we may have touched. I lost control of my front tire spun around sending me to the road pavement in front of the house at 4528 Franconia Road, Alexandria, VA 22310, property next to Mark Twain Middle School. Cars behind stop just long enough for me to pick myself up and walk of the road into the closest driveway. Not a single car stopped to help. And the truck continued speeding down the road. I grabbed my cellphone and called 911. They responded with a firetruck and Fairfax County Police Officer PFC J Kelnan, 703-922-0889. Police report number: 20121920175. When asked to be taken to the hospital I declined, they then had me sign a form for declining. I then walked my bike the last two miles home. My front brakes were rubbing on front wheel so I had to disconnect the break cable from the pads to walk my bike.\"\\n51258814,6810,Washington,DC,20017,Crash Description,\"A white van struck me from behind or on my left side knocking me to the ground. He claimed that I hit him but I was in front of him when the light changed. When I asked him for insurance information he got back in the van and took off. I couldn\\'t concentrate on his plate number. All I remember is that it was a Maryland tag and I think it had the number 65 in it. There was road work at the intersection (6th & P St., NW) with the southbound left lane closed. I was behind the first car waiting in the right lane when the light turned green. The left lane was open immediately after the light but the right lane had a narrow construction trench across it. To avoid the trench I headed to the edge of the left lane and that\\'s the last thing I remember before getting up off the ground with the van driver asking if I was okay. He had to be coming from behind me also in the right lane but when he stopped he was in the left lane and I was lying in the right lane near a steel plate in the road. I was in a daze and didn\\'t realize my left elbow, shoulder and knee were bleeding and that I had a large bruise on my left hip. After he left the scene I dusted myself off, straightened my handlebars and road on to my office at Gallery Place. Ironically I had a physical therapy appointment and as I cleaned myself up for that I noticed that I was bleeding and that my rain jacket, shirt and pants were all torn. I missed my appointment but rescheduled for later that day which by then I had a lot of shoulder and hip pain. My physical therapist checked me out and suggested I go to the doctor if I have any signs of a concussion, as my helmet was also crunched on the left side which no doubt saved me from more serious injuries.\"\\n51321355,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"Not at crash exactly - a driver approached from behind me to within 2 feet of my bike and honked at me (on a wide residential road with no other traffic). I give him the finger, the driver turns his car into me to try and hit me or run me off the road. As the car pushes me into the parked cars on my side of the road I pound on his car with my hand since I am terrified that he will run me over, and that is my first instinct to get him to stop. The drive become irate, drives in front of me, gets out of his car and chases me down the road on foot. When he calms down some, we approach each other and yell at each other. The drive threatens that if I dented his car he \"\"will dent me\"\". Then we both call the police. The police talk to both of us and claim it was a case of road rage. The other drive claimed I tried to run his car off the road. I try to explain that it is not possible for a bike to physically run a car off the road (especially when the car came from behind). Police say there is nothing they can do except facilitate the exchange of information. The police and I leave the scene.\"\\n51375750,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,I saw a pothole at the last minute and swerved to avoid it; my front tire caught in the pothole and I fell.\\n51396615,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,Heading NW on Penn ave NW in bike path.

I had a red flashing light on my backpack and a white flashing light on the front of my bike. As I approached the 2700 block, I heard four horn beeps directly behind me. Before I had time to react, a 70 bus was passing me in the right lane. As the bus passed, it moved further to the right, trapping me between the bus and a line of parked cars. I tried to maintain control of my bike and began braking immediately, but was unable to avoid colliding with the moving bus. I skidded alongside the bus a few times before flipping over my bike and landing beneath a parked car. The bus did not stop, even after being chased by multiple witnesses. Fortunately, one of my friends was cycling directly behind me, and the incident took place in front of a bar with a patio area, so I had plenty of witnesses. 911 was called, DC Metro and Metrotransit police responded and took statements. I refused the ambulance, but traveled to the ER on my own after the incident to get my right knee checked out.\"\\n51402273,6810,Greenbelt,MD,20770,Crash Description,\"Traffic was backed up but bike lane was moving at normal speed south bound 14th street.

I believe I had the rigth of lane as the crossed two lanes of traffic to merge into my land and hit me from the left/rear. Fortunately there was a red light ahead so the vehicle was not going more than 10 mph. I thought we made eye contact, but the vehicle basically merged into me. I\\'m also 100% ok as I managed to land on my feet, my head did not hit anything, and no blood was drawn or bruises made. I think most contact was with my Ortlieb, which I purposefully leave on my rear left for this reason. My bike probably picked up a few scratches, but I dint see any wobbles in the back tire and only a small one in the front that I think truing could take care of. I think the frame is intact as well, but I\\'m not a mechanic and just eyeballed it.\"\\n51433372,6810,University Park,MD,20782,Crash Description,\"This was a minor incident that happened right in front of me during BikeDC, but I thought it was indicative of general Police incompetence during the event, and worth noting to WABA: In Virginia, as we were coming down the hill to head back toward the bridge to get back into DC, two motorcycle police came weaving through the bikers (!!), which included many children and clearly novice riders. Sure enough, several bikers wobbled and fell into each other, I think because they were frightened by the noise of the motorcylcles, perhaps losing balance as they looked around. To be very clear: at no time did a motorcyle appear to come in contact in any way whatsoever with any bicycle. The riders who fell were some feet away from the motorcyles. However, they clearly fell because they were distracted or frightened by the motorcyles. I was about 30 to 50 feet behind the incident. Yes, it was a very minor crash, but it didn\\'t need to happen at all. The motorcycle police did slow down long enough to watch that the riders were able to pick themselves up and that no-one was obviously hurt, but the police did not stop or apologize. A mostly unrelated note: After crossing the bridge, which was bizarrely closed, it was completely confusing which way we should go. Suddenly a DC policewoman showed up on the scene and began directing us. Much to my surprise, she apologized profusely for the screw-up, and was quite helpful! Kudos to this DC Policewoman!\"\\n51433429,6810,Arlington,VA,22204,Crash Description,\"I was traveling south in the bike lane on 14th St. NW. I was just north of the intersection with U Street. I was biking next to a cab driver who initially was in the proper lane. Without warning, and without signaling, the cab driver started turning into the bike lane to make a right turn onto U. I tried to stop and swerve to avoid getting hit. In the process, I skidded on the wet pavement and fell, seriously scraping my let and arm. The cab driver, seeing that I\\'d fallen, ended up continuing straight on 14th instead of turning, and kept going until I started yelling at the top of my lungs and witnesses started yelling and motioning. He eventually stopped on the south side of U.\"\\n51447514,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was headed southbound on 16th. The light at Florida was red, so I was waiting in the lefthand turn lane to turn onto W Street headed East. A car was stopped ahead of me.

I was riding on right shoulder of the road but as I approached the exit for 295 South I moved over and road on the dividing line between the far right and middle lanes. I made this transition as I was passing Crystal Plaza just before the stop light for cars exiting from 295 South onto 197. I continued to ride along the dotted line as mentioned above and was passed by several vehicles on both sides. Nearing the ramp for 295 (but before the lanes split) I was struck from behind by a commercial box truck. The impact threw my body over the handlebars of my bike. I flipped over my bike, and then rolled.\"\\n51498899,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"Came off the Met Branch Trail, turned north on 8th St NE. There had been no movement on the street as I came off the trail. A car parked on the east side of the street opened his door just as I came by. I saw the door with enough time to realize I was in trouble, but not actually do anything. I was knocked off my bike and hit the ground and skidded on my left side (elbow and hip). The driver and passenger got out and helped me gather my things and make sure I was (mostly) okay. Another cyclists happened to pass shortly after the crash and helped as well. The driver offered to give me a ride home, but I declined.

Car turning right from 14th onto Constitution did not stop or yield and I was unable to stop before hitting the passenger side door and falling to the ground. The car was turning from the middle northbound lane onto Constitution because there had been a police stop just south of the intersection on 14th and the driver was trying to get around the blocked right lane. The driver stopped and was immediately responsive and kind and apologetic. She waited with me in her office while we called the police, who eventually responded after an hour. Once they responded, the officer said that since there was no damage to either the vehicle or the bike, and no serious injury, that the policy is not to take a police report. I was disappointed in this policy, especially since we\\'d waited so long for MPD to arrive. Thank you for tracking these crashes.

I ride my bike everyday to work. I have done this for more than a year and a half to get to my Brookland office. Traveling home from work I usually ride on the north side of the street. Traveling to work in the morning, I do ride on the sidewalk and am familiar with the traffic signal at the intersection of the Hospital Service Road and Irving Street NW. I wanted to stop at the Wangari Community Garden, the park triangle not too much further west from the hospital, on my way home. I had plans to tend to my garden plot. I chose to ride on the sidewalk for safety and convenience. I believed it was a safer route to get to the garden. The sidewalk is a designated bike path. With full confidence I know I had the walk signal for crossing the intersection. I recall seeing a car stopped in the curb side right lane, and in the next lane, the inner right hand turn lane, a dark car encroaching, or slightly hanging over the pedestrian walkway, and seeing the signal was clear for me to go. I entered the intersection without breaking. Without time to react I remember seeing the dark car move forward. On impact, I was ejected from my bicycle and I hit the ground on my shoulder and helmet. I was taken by ambulance to Howard Hospital. My injuries were fortunately minor: a bruised nail, scratches on my left lower arm and left shoulder, and some trauma to the neck. I was checked out in the ER and x-rays were taken.

We had the Green light and the traffic speedometer on the side of the road read somewhere between said 27-30 miles per hour, so as usual, I slowed down with my brakes before nearing the intersection at the bottom of the hill. I braked enough that I was going slower than the cars on my left and all the cars passed through the intersection just before I arrived at the bottom of the hill at the intersection. As I approached the intersection while braking, an SUV pulled into the intersection perpendicular to the oncoming traffic, meaning that the car was facing the opposite direction as if the driver was intending to turn left. His car completely blocked the intersection so I saw I couldn\\'t go around him on either side. As I approached I braked and tried to go to the left around his vehicle but the length of the car was too long and blocked the entire space smack in the middle of the intersection. It was sitting there still for a long time while I was braking approaching the base of the hill. The hill is so steep that if I braked sharply I was afraid the speed would throw me over the handlebars into the vehicle, so I braked steadily and anticipated turning to the left to avoid - this was taking place over a period of seconds while approaching the intersection. The light was green and I didn\\'t know what the car was doing parked in the middle of the intersection. I braked and turned slightly to the left to shoot away from the car but hit the rear passenger door of the SUV with my front tire, side of my shoulder and head. My helmet blew off with the impact of my head into the vehicle. I was unconscious for a time because I \\'woke up\\' in the middle of the intersection, the car was gone from the middle of the intersection by that time.\"\\n51932186,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,I was biking west on K street and had near collision where a speeding driver honked for like 3 seconds and proceeded to side swipe me and cut me off. Unnecessary aggression and harassment just for daring to exist on the road.\\n51940085,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was crossing H street (heading north) on 11 th street and my bike\\'s front wheel slipped on the trolley tracks, got caught in the track groove, and I went down.\"\\n51941233,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I was heading west on I street SE approaching the intersection with S. Capitol. I was riding in the bike lane, had a green light with plenty of time on the pedestrian crossing sign - so I knew I would cross the intersection while the light is green. That intersection is wide and sometimes the light can change while in the intersection. I noticed several cars waiting to make a left hand turn on S Cap. The first two had plenty of room before I reached the intersection. The next car made the left turn and almost hit my front tire. I looked up again to see the next car making the same left turn directly into me. I was standing up in on my pedals (hoping to be noticed while approaching and crossing the intersection), hands on the brakes but not enough room for either one of us to stop. My front hit the middle of the front grill of the car. My foot came out of one shoe, and unclipped. I landed on my left shoulder and rolled up on the windshield. I then sat up, checked myself over, realized I could move. Moved off the hood, said something to the driver, grabbed my bike and pulled it off the road. Police were already at the intersection. They secured the intersection, sat me down on the side walk, and started their investigation. DC police, Cap Hill police, DHS police, fire and med were all on the scene. I was transported to Howard, admitted to the trauma center and discharged 4 hours later. xRays showed now broken bone or dislocation. Internal organs seemed fine via ultrasound. Other tests were as negative. Visited another doctor the next day. She identified Grade 2 ligament damage in my shoulder. And, yes, i was wearing a helmet!\"\\n52007039,6810,Arlington,VA,22201,Crash Description,I was passing stopped traffic on the right. A car pulled out in front of me about 30 feet ahead of me. I bailed out.\\n52011092,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"As I was heading west on K st NE on my commute to work, I passed through the intersection of K and 7th St, and the next thing I know I\\'m flown through the air over my handle bars and land face first onto the road. A woman driver of a van was parked in the right lane of the two lane west-bound side of K St. It was directly in front of the elementary school there, and I take that route daily, so I know that often they are cars loading and unloading kids for school there. The light was green at the intersection of K st and 7th st, I\\'m sure, because there were cars turning and I recall thinking that I have the right of way going straight so they better wait for me and not try turning in front of me and cutting me off. After the crash, I had to be helped up from the road, and someone else brought my bike out of the road. My face hit the concrete so my lip was cut and bleeding a lot. A witness, an older man who was a father of children at the school brought me inside immediately to the school nurse. I asked them to call the police but insisted not getting an ambulance because at that time I did not think it was bad enough to go to the hospital. I was extremely shaken up since it was such a surprise crash. Paramedics did come into the school to where I was waiting, but the nurse had cleaned me up and gave me ice, so they didn\\'t attend to me. The policeman finally came in after about 30 or 40 minutes and asked me what happened, but kept looking away, and after only a minute or so he literally just walked away in the middle of me telling me my story. On my way inside the school earlier, I remember hearing the driver of the vehicle saying I ran into her door (i.e.: she was trying to blame me) and that I damaged her door (I don\\'t think if this was true or not). The policeman finally came back after about 20 more minutes and just asked for my information and wrote his down. He never asked me to tell the rest of my account, so I do not feel like my side was accurately portrayed at all for the police report. Everyone kept asking if I was sure I didn\\'t want to go to the hospital, but I thought I would be okay so I insisted not too. My bike was unridable from the scene of the crash. The impact moved the handlebars/headset several inches off center. And I was still too shaken up to bike then anyways. Since the policeman hadn\\'t said anything about tickets, I asked him if he was writing anyone a citation and he said no because there were conflicting accounts and he said witnesses gave conflicting accounts too. At this time, about 32 hours after the crash, the police report is still not ready to pick up at the police station.\"\\n52098490,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"A car was waiting at a red light that controls a parking garage exit onto Lee Highway in Arlington, near key bridge. The car was waiting past the stop line, fully blocking the Custis Trail which follows a sidewalk along Lee Highway. I was traveling west on Custis Trail, slightly uphill. I slowed and attempted to go around the front of the car at around 5mph. As I merged back onto the sidewalk/trail, my front tire caught an uneven lip on the road that was blocked from my line of sight by the car bumper. I fell onto the sidewalk.\"\\n52120999,6810,Alexandria,VA,22306,Crash Description,\"I was riding southbound on Commonwealth intending to make a left turn onto Mt Vernon. I reached the intersection just after the light turned red, and positioned myself at the front of the bike box near the left of the travel lane. When I heard a car pull up behind me, I signaled a left turn. I again signaled a left turn when the traffic signal for Mt. Vernon traffic turned yellow and rolled forward a bit outside of the bike box (forgetting that northbound commonwealth traffic would get to go before I did). I then waited just forward of the bike box and still to the left of the travel lane until our light turned green, at which time I proceeded through the intersection. I went straight across the westbound lane on Mt Vernon and just as I began to lean to make my left turn into the eastbound lane, I was hit from behind/left by a vehicle and thrown to the ground.\"\\n52145549,6810,Silver Spring,MD,20906,Crash Description,\"I commute to and from work about four days a week and generally use Connecticut Avenue on the DC stretch of my commute. Occasionally, on my morning commute, if the weather is exceptionally nice or I have extra time, I use Beach Drive and take the road by the Zoo parking lots up to Connecticut Ave. This is the most direct route from Beach Drive to my work, which is accross the street from the main entrance to the Zoo. It also allows me to avoid Connecticut Ave, which I prefer to do, although time does not usually permit it. As I was riding my way up the far right side of the roadway on Jewett Street I was signaled to stop by a police officer riding in the passenger side of a blue pick-up truck which was following me. He stepped out of the truck and asked me if I had seen the sign at some previous point on the roadway. I responded that I had not noticed or known of any sign. He said that they\\'ve been stopping pedestrians and bikers from travelling on the road, and from my understanding, based on a sign which prohibits pedestrians. I did not feel like arguing with him as I wanted to get to work quickly. I also wanted to verify that the sign he was referring to did not prohibit bicycles, which I later did indeed confirm. The sign clearly prohibits pedestrians only, but obviously and sadly he has not been educated as to the fact that bikes are vehicles. I humbly abided by his orders as to avoid confrontation and told him I did not know I was not allowed to ride there and would use Connecticut Avenue next time. He made me ride up the remainder of the hill on a bumpier narrow paved section appearing as a walkway partitioned to the right of the roadway by a very narrow concrete strip flush to the pavement. This \"\"walkway\"\" eventually ended so I had no option but to ride on the roadway. The officer did not appear to be part of the Zoo Police Department, but the truck he was riding in had U.S. Government tags. Apparently, he was a Federal officer of some sort. I am very upset with the incident and I believe I have a right to the roadway and do not want to be stopped by police there anymore.\"\\n52194458,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"Was on a light/enjoyable training ride down GW Trail to Mount Vernon and back to Capitol Hill. I stopped at the stop sign at intersection of Jefferson and S. Royal. A Nissan Pathfinder made a right turn onto S. Royal, I proceeded behind the car at a safe distance of just over 10 feet at a speed between 15 and 18mph, the same as the car. Looking up the entire time, I saw the turn signal blink twice without any brakelight and the driver immediately hooked his car into a diagnol parking spot cutting across my lane without giving me a chance to evade. I locked up both tires, leaned back, tried steering to the right and braced for impact - all in about 2 seconds time. My front tire made contact with the car\\'s right front tire, I flew forward slamming my left shoulder into the diagonol between the windshield and passenger side door, which sent me flying over the hood of the car inverted, at least 10 feet. Once I felt myself go inverted I put my hands over my head, tucked my chin to chest in order to somersault as taught in martial arts training. I contacted the pavement on the back of my head somersaulting, slamming on to my back. Thankfully I was able to smack my hands down along my sides to reduce the impact on lower back. Police office wrote me a ticket for improper passing on the right when the driver should have been written for failing to turn signal resulting in reckeless driving as stated by Virginia state law when failure to indicate a turn results in an accident. I have a separated shoulder and a torn labrum. My orthopedic surgeon said I was lucky to have walked into his office. Now I have a court date for August 29, 9:30am to fight the ticket say this accident was my fault. I ride 2500 miles/year on average and know how to behave on the road.\"\\n52210942,6810,Columbus,OH,43221,Crash Description,D-1 who is the striking vehicle was driving East bound.

The person who doored me was the rear seat passenger in a car that stopped in the parking spaces in front of the hotel, outside the bike lane. He hooked my front wheel, which flipped the bike around so that I spun 180 degrees and crashed on the sidewalk. Something sharp, possibly the door latch, raked my hand and forearm, cutting me in multiple places. I had other contusions. However I was not injured seriously, no broken bones, and did not hit my head or lose consciousness. My front wheel was totally dished. The situation there is very dangerous. The hotel has created parking on the outside of the bike lane for guests who are registering. The only way for them to get into the hotel\\xa0is to open their doors into the bike lane and walk across it.\"\\n52431059,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,I was hit by an SUV that attempted to pass me on the left.\\n52482793,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was heading southbound toward a green light on 4th St at Eye St. NW No cars were behind or in front of me in my lane. A car approached the intersection heading northbound (south of the intersection). The driver made the left as I was crossing through the intersection (light was still green) when he collided with me and my bike. It happened so fast, but once I was on the ground, I immediately got up (human instinct) and was able to walk and felt no pain in my legs. The driver was very apologetic and said he didn\\'t see me. It was dusk, but plenty of daylight out, I had my helmet light on, had light clothes and a reflective pants leg strap, as well as reflective parts on my commuter back pack that face forward. I don\\'t know if he was using a cell phone. There were a few good samaritans around, one called 911, and at least one other stayed back as a witness.\"\\n52500401,6810,Arlington,VA,22213,Crash Description,\"Was riding west bound on E street, past the North Capitol intersection there is a bike lane and I specifically chose E street for this reason. The black 4-door sedan was double parked over the bike lane in front of the Hotel George. I checked traffic behind me before passing the car on the left-hand side. As I came around the car, the door was opened. I hit the door head-on on my bicycle and fell to the ground. There was a witness to the accident. Decided to get out of the road as quickly as possible. I was unsure what to do and asked others for advice. I asked if the police should be called and no one responded. I was unsure how to proceed. My bike on quick glance didn\\'t look broken. I had my helmet on and didn\\'t hit my head. I had cuts and bruises on my knees, hands, and chest. My right knee was hurting a lot, and I hoped the knee would stop hurting in a few minutes. The hotel staff gave me bandaids. The driver was very polite. I got the driver\\'s information. There was a witness who gave me his information and wrote down the vehicle license. Since I work on 25 Mass Ave NW (about 3 blocks away), I decided to walk the bike back to my work to park it and decide what I wanted to do from there. My knee was hurting quite a bit and I decided to go to the hospital. Once at the hospital, I contacted the driver\\'s employer and she was very upset that the police had not been called. I then checked the WABA website, saw that a police report needed to be completed. I called the cops and they came and took my information at GW hospital. The cops did not say that it was too late for a report to be made.\"\\n52586625,6810,Seattle,WA,98105,Crash Description,\"Crossing in the crosswalk on the EB side of the intersection with the walk signal.

Capitol, I was heading toward green light when grey car flashed up on my left, going parallel, and then turned right in front of me. I yelled but the windows were up. I thought I heard nearby pedestrians yelling, too (witnesses later told me they yelled, too). Witnesses said I put out my left arm to brace against the car upon impact. The car kept going and I hit with front tire, also turning me right. I tumbled off bike and landed on left knee/elbow. The car kept_on_going. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t have the foresight to stay put and call police - wanted to get off the busy corner and kind passersby offered me rides (after one lady tried but failed to run down the driver).

The driver stopped and asked me if I was alright. I stood up and took an inventory of myself and replied that I was OK and waived her on, telling her I was OK. I believe she pulled out of the alley way between 11th and 13th on Monroe. I didn\\'t see her coming up behind me and was pinched between two cars. My bike is equipped with lights and I was wearing a helmet. I had two lights on my bike, one on the front and one on the back. There was a pedestrian there who suggested I report the incident to this site.

I think it is very difficult for cars pulling into driveways / parking lots to see around the parked cars -- I think a parking spot should be removed so bikes and cars can see traffic more clearly. By the time a car noses into the bike lane to see, it is too late anyway. While this is the first time I\\'ve been in a crash due to this, it is NOT the first time cars have pulled in front of me to enter the parking lot.\"\\n53225683,6810,Arlington,VA,22209,Crash Description,\"I crossed Quinn and a car came from Quinn without stopping.

It was peak rush hour, so it was a virtual parking lot for the cars. As I was riding up the bike lane, a driver that was in the furthest left lane and going straight, decided that she wanted to get into the left turn lane, which at that point was a crossover car and bike merge area. The left turn lane was clear all the way up the road, so she must have thought she could just accelerate quickly up the wide open lane and bypass all the stopped traffic. The problem was that she didn\\'t look first, which she admitted, and pulled right into me, very suddenly. If she had merged more gradually, I could have braked in time. But she moved quite quickly, and I only had about half a second to stop. I veered left to avoid her, but ran out of pavement, and she hit my right shoulder with the left passenger door of her car as she was sharply cutting me off. Then my front wheel hit the curb, and I flipped over it, along with my bike. I was not seriously injured and there was no damage to my bike, so I didn\\'t file a police report. It was completely dark, but I had a helmet light, handlebar light, rear strobe flashing light, and wheel lights on both front and rear wheels. If someone from WABA could email me, I would appreciate it. I\\'m just curious about whether there have been more accidents on the L Street bike lane than other bike lanes. I\\'m also curious about why the lane was designed this way.

As far as I can remember I must have been mostly stopped at that point because my right foot landed on the ground and I remained steady and upright. The break lever got bent in slightly and my left arm definitely snapped back and away quickly but no physical damage to myself (besides minor soreness in my left arm, the same kind of feeling as after a workout, no big deal) or my bike (brought it to the shop for a look-see and it was deemed fine). I asked the man who opened the door for his information and he walked with me to the sidewalk and gave me his business card and cell phone number while the Uber driver sped away as soon as the passenger closed the door - before we even got on the sidewalk. I\\'m kind of appalled that the driver did not 1) ask if I was okay or even 2) check to see if there was damage to the car. I\\'ll note that the man told me that I \"\"wasn\\'t in a bike lane\"\" (wrong) and that I should be careful - luckily the most aggravating part of all this is an attempted man-splained lecture based on false information. Anyway I told him that didn\\'t matter and we all have the responsibility to be careful and that I have the right to ride on all roads.

As I approached the last intersection before Tuckerman, which was a smaller residential side street called Fox Run, a car coming in the opposite direction (Southbound) on Gainsborough Rd. turned left suddenly into Fox Run eastbound. (\"\"left hook\"\" type accident) I am certain that he did not signal or I would have been more on-guard for him to turn. I ride very defensively all the time. I don\\'t believe there was a car in front of him southbound that would have obscured my view of him or his turn signal, but I was very surprized by his sudden turn in to the side street and thus I didn\\'t have time to hit the brakes. I was able to swerve somewhat to avoide a completely perpendicular impact. I recall starting to flip over with my head/body heading directly for the hood of the car as I closed my eyes for the impact. I didn\\'t hear any screatching brakes/tires that I can recall. I opened my eyes to find myself lying flat on the ground on my back and started to sit up finding a number of people arriving around me to make sure I was OK. I don\\'t believe I lost consciousness. Police and EMT were called. Took statements of me, driver, and eyewitness. Police had to correct errors in the PoliceReport that had the eyewitness listed as the victim(me) initially. EMT checked me out, but I didn\\'t want to go to the ER at the time. Was going to ride home, but bike too damaged. Officer took me home in squad-car. As the adrenaline began to wear off later in the evening and I realized I was more injured than I thought at first, I went to the ER that evening and learned I had a broken wrist.\"\\n54268781,6810,Washington,DC,20008,Crash Description,\"I was biking west on Calvert Ave NW in the right lane with my front and rear light on.

It hit me on my left side. The car was travelling south as well and seemed to be attempting to pass me on the left side, but I never heard a honk to even warn me of the presence. The initial impact was to the front fork of my bike, which spun me into the car, where my hip struck the hood area. I was then throw to the right lane in the middle of the intersection, first landing on my head, then on my back. By the time I sat up the car was at least a block away, but it appeared to be a beige/gold sedan, with Impala like lights, though I\\'m unsure of the lights. I nor the people on the corner saw the license plate, nor any details on the driver. I collected my bike pieces, and some pieces of the car, and moved them to the corner before calling 911.

I accidentally hit someone’s\\' mirror as the space between the parked car and the car on my left was narrow. Unfortunately, the owner of the car falsely claimed that I had hit her car door and car hood. The bumps on her car door were at a height that nothing in the bike could\\'ve had hit her door, especially because my leg would have been caught in the middle. Additionally, I was riding a bikeshare, a very heavy bike, so hitting a car with it would\\'ve had caused mayor damage and I would\\'ve had to be riding really fast to cause such a damage, which was not the case, as I was biking slowly uphill. The driver was irate, screaming and threatening (not violence, but just to report me to her friends on facebook and such). I didn’t respond to her threats and decided to wait for cops. We waited approximately 40 minutes for MPD to show up. The officer was friendly, took both our statements and gave me a citation for riding abreast, he indicated he \\'needed to give me a ticket.\"\" He informed me that I could contest the ticket if I wanted to. I wasn’t clear about the need for the ticket or what cycling abreast meant at the time. From an online search it seems like it wasn’t the correct offense.

The side of his car (just behind the side window) struck me while I was in the bicycle lane, throwing me off my bicycle. After the crash, he moved his car into the center of the lane so it would appear that I was at fault. He got out of his car to take photos of his car, while I lay bleeding and stunned in the roadway. Another cyclist called the police and I was taken by ambulance to the emergency room. While at the ER a police officer came to take my statement. Based on the testimony of a driver who saw a group of cyclists moving from the bike lane into the right lane, the officer gave me a citation for changing lanes without caution.

The driver was watching the traffic looking coming in the opposite direction. When all the vehicles passed, I thought he turned and looked on me, so I waved my hand and told him to proceed. He moved slightly forward and stopped, so I put out my hand to indicate that I was going to cross in front of his truck. As I proceeded to cross, I felt his truck move forward and hit me over, he continued driving and I got pulled under his truck and I was lodged under his truck while he pulled me down the road.

Contact was not made with body, but the impact caused me to be thrown off the bicycle. OF NOTE: This intersection crosswalk is very dangerous because it is approximately 25-30 feet from the stop sign when travelling west. I\\'ve almost seen pedestrians get struck here several times because almost no one stop fully at the stop sign, and given the distance to the crosswalk, they are already at the speed limit when they reach it. Motorists rarely stop at this crosswalk for pedestrians or bicycles when headed west, DESPITE being a block a way from the police station on V Street.\"\\n54637208,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"There are 3 lanes ending at the crosswalk onto Dupont Circle. The left ongoing traffic lane and the middle bike lane and the right hand traffic lane. I was in the bike lane and upon coming up to the intersection I realized that the bike lane was fully occupied by a yellow and black ford escape taxicab. There was also another car to the right that occupied the right hand traffic lane. There were still people in the crosswalk and a red light. As I approached closer, I proceeded to merge into the middle/left side of the left hand traffic lane. The traffic was at a full stop at the time. As I came up to the intersection I passed the ford escape taxicab that was completely in the bike lane and partially on the right side of the main (left) traffic lane. As I completed the passing of the cab, the light turned blinky yellow and the cab quickly hit the gas and merging hard, swerving into the main left lane of traffic - the one that I was in. This caused him to hit me on his front left driver side bumper, as I had already passed him and was ahead of his left rear view mirror. This knocked me down directly in front of the front bumper. The cabbie\\'s passengers, two older men, jumped out and immediately accused me of swerving in front of the cab. Which is ridiculous, as all I was trying to do was proceed into the circle when the cab hit me from behind. The cab was not cited for blocking the bike lane either. I can provide photographs that show the accident in pretty accurate detail. The police report number is 072990 and the citation number is 263166105. There is something terrifying here. This is the same situation, almost to a T, as Alice Swanson. She was also cited for Failure to Yield Right of Way. Except then someone had to die - she was cited was posthumously. As in, she died to a trunk running her over while turning right, but was cited for driving her bike into it. Here we have the same exact police department district, a motor vehicle hitting a bicyclist, in an intersection where the bike lane markings end, and the police give the same citation to the bicyclist - failure to yield right of way. Bicyclist are getting hit and cited because the police department assumes its way into assigning them fault. When it comes to actually liability in a court, the truth comes out. Look at the hush money million(s?)- err settlement - that the owners of the dump truck paid out to the Swanson family. This is galling. You\\'d think the police were on the side of the people hitting bicyclist. Or maybe it\\'s the police actually doing it - http://dcist.com/2012/06/driver_who_ran_down_cyclist_last_au.php Regardless, the real problem here is the layout of the bike lanes/streets. DC - and specifically Dupont Circle needs more dedicated biking roads that don\\'t allow significant thru vehicular traffic. New Hampshire Ave should follow the model that it follows between U and T St NW all the way to Dupont circle and possibly beyond. One way cars with biking/walking in both directions. This will help build walkable, bikable slow local roads for those of us who don\\'t choose to drive motor vehicles through the heart and lungs of our city. All the roads in the area allow cars, but what we need is a multi-modal and safe ways to get around. Setting up situations like this one, with a bike lane disappearing into a frustrating, traffic light driven circle that prioritizes walking and driving, is a recipe for terrorized bicyclists. Bicycles need their own lane in the circle, and it would be great if they were matched alongside the pedestrian walkways and traffic lights to avoid slowing motor vehicle traffic down. Here is the note that I sent the policewoman that first came to the scene and gave me her card. \"\"Virginia Dineen, Thanks for taking my police report. I\\'m sorry to receive a citation - although I notice that you name isn\\'t on it. I wonder if the other police officer had come upon the scene as you did if he would have made a different choice. You saw me as I was directly after the accident without moving - I was knocked down in front of the left side front bumper of the car. So let\\'s reverse the situation. Imagine that I\\'m in the bike lane and the car is in the left lane. If I merged out of the bike lane and hit the rear right bumper of the car, I would be sited for hitting a car (understandably). The cab did the same thing, but is trying to claim that I somehow swerved in front of the car making it my fault. Every lane of traffic in that situation is required to turn right. Because one of the lanes disappear (the bike lane), if you are in that lane, you are required to merge into another lane. The cab was in the bike lane. The cab was occupying the bike lane, a legal lane of traffic and choose to merge into the left lane of traffic. It was actually very unexpected for me, as I was simply proceeding from the left lane of traffic into the left lane of the circle. It faintly felt like the driver actually decided to merge deep into the left lane as traffic was forced to turn right to follow the circle. Deeper than he was required too, cutting off my ability to turn right and hitting me, joining the normal left lane of traffic in the circle.\"\"\"\\n54652376,6810,New Brunswick,NJ,08901,Crash Description,\"I was riding along the right-hand side of Georgia Avenue going south. The Toyota was ahead of me by 20-30 feet and began slowing. I did not see a turn signal, so did not increase following distance. The car began turning, leaving me no room for me and I grazed along the car\\'s right hand side, my handlebar hitting the car\\'s mirror before the car and I both slowed to a stop. Dr. David Miramontes (The Medical Director for DC FEMS) was driving on his way to work and witnessed the incident.

As I came up to the place where Madison Ave intersections Blair Rd, a driver of a small (car-frame-based) SUV took advantage of a gap in the north-bound traffic to turn left into Madison Ave. The driver started the left turn just as I was passing his vehicle; the front left fender of his car struck my bike at very low speed, knocking me down into the northbound lane.\"\\n54964792,6810,Alexandria,VA,22312,Crash Description,I hit a portion of the road that had was elevated due to a meter.

I believe the car in front of the Car2Go was turning left, perhaps suddenly. The Car2Go simultaneously slammed on its breaks and veered sharply to the right, side swiping me and forcing me into the next lane. My body weight was thrown onto the right rear exterior of the vehicle and I slid down towards the rear tire well, screaming. The car stopped and I slid to and along the pavement, braced to be hit from behind as I was now between two lanes. Fortunately, both cars behind us managed to stop. I was so flustered and in shock that I left the scene before calling the police and of course regret that now. I did make a police report but they did not seem optimistic that they could do anything without the license plate number. It seems to me there could easily be video footage of this accident and that it would also be easy to track down who is renting Car2Go cars at particular times as I believe they rent hourly. The police were not at all interested in my description of the driver which I found particularly frustrating. They were clearly not going to make any effort to find her. She should have offered me her information but by the time I collected myself on the sidewalk, she had left the scene.\"\\n55153951,6810,Fairfax,VA,22032,Crash Description,\"Me and the skateboarder had a head-on collision on the multi-user path along Roberts.

Very shaken, I was almost more distressed by the Arlington police department\\'s initial view that they did not want to prepare / file a traffic report on this accident. My understanding after talking with the police officer is that they will indeed file a traffic report which I will request a copy of later this week. I\\'m still distressed as to the actions of the police, and will raise at the Arlington Bicycle Advisory Committee meeting, WABA, etc.\"\\n55616464,6810,Rockville,MD,20850,Crash Description,There was a power line down in the road that had apparently been covered by some kind of black material (rubber? plastic?) that was difficult to distinguish from the road surface. It initially appeared to be a crack in the road. As I was going down hill I was unable to tell what this was until I was right on top of it. I don\\'t recall any warning signs or anything bright colored to alert cyclists to a difficult-to-see road hazard. As I went over the covered cable my wheels slid out from under me and I hit and slid along the road surface heavily on my left side. The impact to my bike is a badly damaged STI shifter and possibly bent handlebars. Won\\'t know more until I bring it to the shop. I did not call the police or emergency services as I as able to ride my bike home (~4-5 miles) and m focus was getting home to clean up my wounds and get to the urgent care clinic.\\n55656763,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"I was cycling north on 14th street. Traffic to my left was stopped in heavy traffic. The driver of the car tried to pull through stopped traffic to pull into the gas station. It was a blind turn as he tried to turn in front of a stopped large truck. He pulled through the driving lane and across the bike lane as I came up. He hit me. I seemed to be ok at the time. I asked him for his drivers license and insurance information and he began to berate me that he doesn\\'t need to provide that and that it was my fault. At that time, I disengaged from him and called 911.\"\\n55673221,6810,Alexandria,VA,22304,Crash Description,\"I was pacing traffic heading east on Clarendon Blvd approaching North Cleveland St. I was riding next to a car, towards it\\'s right rear quarter panel. I looked over my left shoulder to see if anybody was trying to merge into the bike lane to turn. There were several cars behind my position. I did not see any turn signal from the closest car behind me so I turned my head forward again. When i returned my gaze forward, the car that had been next to me had begun to turn into my path of travel. At this point, the car was already very close to me. I could only see the forward half of the car out of the left of my vision. I attempted to turn away from the car. I then woke up on the ground, on my back.\"\\n55696006,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was riding south-eastbound on Florida. The driver was turning left from the NW bound lane onto P street, without signalling, and hit me. I had a headlamp, wheel light and reflectors.\"\\n55726802,6810,Arlington,VA,22201,Crash Description,\"I was biking down the Custis Trail as I often do, and stopped at the driveway of the parking lot to the Marriott hotel where a car was pulling out. I slowed down, as I am an extremely cautious and nervous biker, and hoped that they saw me and inched along past the driveway, purposely and slowly. I was hoping that for some reason, if I went slowly, like the speed of a walking pedestrian, they would stop and see me. Instead, they weren\\'t paying attention and didn\\'t see me and hit me with the front of their car (on the side of my bike and body). I fell over and hurt my left shin (bloody and bruised). I was mostly just shaken up, incredibly scared and crying because it was my first accident with a car. A friendly and concerned pedestrian called 911 and an ambulance checked me out to see if I was okay. They took my pulse and vitals and said that I was fine and to rest my leg. The police came and took a police report and gave me a ticket for \"\"fail to yield row entering from private road/drive.\"\" They claimed that it was my fault that I didn\\'t stop at the stop sign, when I did. I just did not have a witness to back me up, and I was flustered the first time I spoke my statement to the rude policewoman, who said that she would throw me in jail if I did not sign her form. She did not explain what the form was for, just that I had to sign it or else I would be thrown in jail. I now have to pay a ticket fine and court fee for this accident, in which, I believe that I was the victim. The driver had a passenger with them, so they then had a witness to back them up. The kinder, other, policeman said that if I had a fellow biker with me, they could have testified and been a witness, but in fact, I did not. The nice pedestrian who called the ambulance had walked away once he knew I was safely inside the ambulance, so I do not have his name as a witness of the incident, as he had been walking behind me when the accident occurred. The car left immediately upon learning that they were not at fault and did not even ask if I was okay. I believe that this is unfair for me to walk away with a ticket while the car drove away with no consequences.\"\\n55860395,6810,Mount Rainier,MD,20712,Crash Description,\"I was traveling north, toward Brookland on the Met Branch Trail I was approaching the stairs (not the ramp) to the new pedestrian bridge (train overpass) that goes to Rhode Island Ave Metrorail station. Coming from that direction, the trees and shrubbery planted there blocked the view of the stairs. As I came around the curve, there was one young black guy (20ish) behind the shrubbery and 4 more guys at the bottom of the stairs. I have enough street sense to have avoided a group like that, but could not see them until I was virtually right next to them. The guy nearest me approached and hit me (maybe with something heavy), which knocked me to the ground, with the bike sliding out from under me. While I was on the ground, some one kept hitting me -- mainly on the head . As I started to recover from the fall, I saw him grab the bike and start down the trail toward the NOMA station. I noticed the other 4 guys were not approaching me, but stayed at the stairs. I pursued the attacker on the bike as best I could, but he quickly outpaced me on the bike. I continued to walk down the trail toward NOMA, hoping to glimpse him on side street. About 200 yards down the trail, another cyclist approached headed toward Brookland, I flagged him down to warn him not to go up the trail. Told him what happened and he let me use his cell phone to call 911. The police responded fairly quickly, all told, about 4 units came, including a Med Van,.\"\\n55863307,6810,Washington,DC,20515,Crash Description,I was biking in the center bike lane when a car tried to make an illegal U-Turn right in front of me. I hit her car before I could even put my breaks on. The back tire rolled over my right foot. She pulled over to the side of the road where I joined her along with a police officer who had witnessed the accident.\\n55978503,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"I was riding in the right lane of the southbound side of 14th Street. I had just past L when a car sideswiped me, probably hit my handlebar. After it passed me, I lost control and fell to the ground. I landed on my left side. The car did not stop so I didn\\'t get any information from it.\"\\n55990174,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,I was riding in the bike line heading north on 14th street. I had just passed Spring St when a Minivan driving next to me began to encroach approximately 1/3 of the way into the bike lane. I used my left hand to pat on the window of the Minivan to alert them to my presence. As I rode past the Minivan I made eye contact with the Driver and once my bike was about halfway cleared of his minivan he turned the steering wheel right and struck my rear wheel which caused me to fall to the ground. The driver stayed at the scene. I called 911 when I realized there was damage to my bike and that it was unable to be ridden. Police took a statement from two witnesses who saw that the driver intentionally swerved to hit my bicycle. Driver was issued infraction: Failure to maintain lane.\\n55998826,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"i was waiting at the red light, in the bike box on 16th st, heading south. The minivan was in the dedicated right turn lane next to me and vehicles were on my left and behind me. When the light turned green i started to go and the minivan attempted to pass me in the intersection to try and get in the through travel lane instead of the right turn lane. The van struck my right leg, tossing me to the ground. The driver paused and saw that i stood up and proceeded on. My bike was fine and i seemed to not have any bodily harm either. I assumed everything was fine and the pain in my wrist was just a sprain. Later that evening the pain and swelling was getting hard to take, so i went to the ER. After X-rays it was clear that i had actually broken my wrist.\"\\n56021047,6810,Arlington,VA,22205,Crash Description,\"I was traveling west in a bike lane on Fairfax Dr. The bike lane ends just prior to the intersection. I remained in the same line of travel in the outer lane. The driver of the car turned right on red from N. Wakefield St. onto N. Fairfax Dr. and struck my right side with the left side and corner of the front bumper of her car. The front half of my bicycle was in front of her car at the time of impact and my right leg and pedal, and front wheel were hit by the bumper. I felt the car accelerate after initial impact. I was thrown from my bike and landed in the middle of the lane I was traveling in.\"\\n56044588,6810,Washington,DC,20017,Crash Description,I was biking South on 14th St. around Thomas Circle and a cab entered into the traffic circle from Mass Ave and hit me on my right side.\\n56076402,6810,Silver Spring,MD,20901,Crash Description,Biking in the bike lane when a car door opened. Fell off bike into the street.\\n56113401,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"A driver merged into the bike lane to park in front of me. I skidded to a stop approx. 5-10 ft behind vehicle. I remained stopped. Driver began attempting to back into the spot. I began to yell, \"\"Biker!\"\" Driver continued to back into me. I tried to yell more/ louder, but the driver hit me and continued backing up. I began banging on the trunk of the car, the driver continued backing up. The front wheel of my bike was getting pulled under the trunk of the car, at which point the car stopped. The driver got out of the car and said, \"\"I didn\\'t see you.\"\" I yelled, \"\"That\\'s not an excuse, you hit me. I\\'m in the bike lane.\"\" The driver appeared frustrated, got back in the car, slammed the door, and drove off. Many other cars and pedestrians were around, none stopped to help at the scene of the accident. I\\'ve contacted WABA because I participate in Women & Bicycles events.\"\\n56216556,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\\n56289398,6810,Washington,DC,20005,Crash Description,\"I was westbound in the center-lane bike lanes of Pennsylvania Ave. A westbound motorist suddenly whipped into a U-turn into the bike lanes. I braked but my bike hit the car, and I toppled over, banging my left knee and hand. A portion of the car\\'s running board was knocked off, and my front wheel was badly bent.\"\\n56293095,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"Cyclist was riding west on Mass Ave NE, going between 15 and 20mph. Car traffic on Mass Ave NE was moderate, with speeds probably around 25 mph. A small black SUV heading east on Mass Ave NE attempted a left turn onto D St NE. The driver and the cyclist saw each other and both braked. The vehicle became completely stationary at the moment of the crash; the cyclist still had some speed and collided with the front bumper of the SUV. The cyclist fell back and to his right. Because the SUV was fully stopped, he and his bike were not run over. The bike\\'s front left fork was sheered in two a couple inches above the wheel hub. (Note 1: The turn the SUV made is illegal but very commonly done; it\\'s a confusing intersection in several ways, and I see vehicles of all types make errors and run red lights there. A Capitol Police officer drove right through a red light on D St NE a few weeks ago while I was there.) (Note 2: I was a witness. I was on my own bike waiting to make a right on red from D St NE onto Mass Ave westbound; I planned to join traffic following the cyclist who got hit).\"\\n56306806,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was in the bike lane headed south on 14th st, with a line of stopped cars (heavy traffic) also headed south. At Perry St, a minivan made a quick left turn without looking. His view of the bike lane was blocked by the stopped cars. I was at speed and slammed on my breaks while yelling, which caused the minivan to slam on his breaks and completely block the bike lane/street. With no where to go I hit the side panel of the minivan and was thrown off my bike. The driver got out apologizing, said it was his fault and that he couldn\\'t see me because of the cars. A pedestrian stopped and offered to stay with me, but I felt ok and my bike looked ok so I continued on my commute.\"\\n56348030,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,Car made left turn and braked just in front of me; I applied brakes but there was not enough room to stop. Hit passenger side of SUV and went over hood.\\n56422461,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"Approaching the 19th Street intersection on N Lynn Street, my tire got caught in the gap between a grate cover (perhaps the metro?) and the grate opening, and the momentum pushed me and bike into the rear passenger side of a car, stopped at the intersection.\"\\n56480605,6810,Bethesda,MD,20817,Crash Description,A speed bump was placed on the bike trail to cover an electrical wire running across the path.

I blacked out monetarily and was thrown from my bike. A few witnesses helped me to the curb to address my wounds. I was bleeding and someone grabbed a few napkins from the nearby cafe so I could stop the bleeding. Not realizing the extent of my injuries, I declined when someone offered to call an ambulance. The driver and the passenger stayed at the scene but didn\\'t say anything to me. One of the witnesses (whose information I have) helped to gather the driver\\'s information. The drivers left and I walked my bike home. I was doored in the same spot a few months prior, and sustained bruising to my arm. I no longer take 18th Street. The road is dangerous because there are so many Ubers, taxis, etc. stopping in the middle of the road, pulling to the side without indicating, etc. Now I\\'m terrified of biking in the bike lane, and I keep to the left of the bike lane as much as possible (to the chagrin of drivers who don\\'t know that we\\'re supposed to share the road). It\\'s lose-lose.\"\\n56481481,6810,Washington,DC,20008,Crash Description,I was biking in a protected bike lane on Klingle Rd and a barrier that is used to separate the bike lane and the road had become unbolted from the pavement and moved perpendicular to the bike lane. My bike hit the barrier and I flew forward off my bike.\\n56481955,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,I was riding southbound passing stopped traffic on the left and to the right of the parking lane on the right. Vehicle pulled out into road attempting to force her way into the stream of traffic from the alley way without being able to see me from behind parked cars nor leaving any room/time for me to escape without injury. I hit the front corner of the car as she slowed flipping over the hood of the vehicle landing on the other side and fracturing a metatarsal.\\n56494006,6810,Washington,DC,20016,Crash Description,\"I was riding home, coming up Loughboro Rd this guy comes past me probably just by a few inches. Didn\\'t need to, he was clearly trying to intimidate me. He got stuck at the next light at Foxhall, so I went past and made the turn on to Foxhall a couple cars ahead of him. I keep going home as I normally would and make the left on to Cathedral Ave, when I hear him a few yards back. The road is residential and has lots of cars parked on both sides of the street, so I am in the middle of the road, I didn\\'t want him to side swipe me again. I turn around and can see him trying to come around me, but he doesn\\'t have the space. When I slow down for the stop sign he barrels past me, stops his car, gets out, wielding a metal pole, yelling he was going to \"\"beat me to death\"\". I had already taken my phone out and was taking as many pictures as I could while dodging his car. Fortunately the light was green and I was able to jump on a side walk. I think he knew that I had pictures of him acting insane, so he just drove off. I have pictures of his truck, license plate, and him out of his truck brandishing the metal pole.\"\\n56511112,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was headed southbound on 19th St. toward my private yoga client\\'s house.

He then without signaling pulled an illegal U-turn. I couldn\\'t stop myself fast enough let\\'s plan on the brakes. My front tire hit the front left we\\'ll well I\\'ve his car. I broke so hard that I went flying over my handlebars, over his car, and onto the pavement.

First car crossed 15th St. NW and second car failed to stop at stop sign and accelerated after the car, turning illegally right (South) onto 15th St. NW, cutting into the 15th St. cycletrack. I was going North on the cycletrack and was hit by the car as it accelerated and turned right over the bike lane. I landed on top of the car hood and my front tire was warped beyond repair. Driver claimed they had stopped, although bikers and pedestrians confirmed they had not.\"\\n56626373,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,The metro bus driver driving bus 2378 at 09:30 AM on 11/25/2014 failed to yield to a bicyclist in the bike lane before merging into the bike lane. He came within inches of crushing me against a parked car. I pulled up alongside the bus to speak with the driver. I informed him that he had to yield to a bicyclist in the bike lane before changing lanes. He was rude to me and said that he did not have to yield. This man apparently believes that he has the right of way to literally run over and kill a cyclist. I feel unsafe with this man driving along the bike lane I have to ride to work every day. I submitted this complaint to WMATA asking for a phone call or email to follow up because I expect to hear how this driver will be released or retrained.\\n56633108,6810,Washington,DC,20017,Crash Description,\"I was riding westbound in the rightmost lane on Michigan Ave. I was taking the lane. I heard a screech of tires behind me, then felt the car hit my bike tire and my pannier on the left side of my bike as the black sedan sideswiped me, then got into the lane right in front of me and took a sharp right into the hospital center via 1st St NW. The sideswipe didn\\'t knock me over, but I was shaken up. The car did not stop to see if I was OK. I peered down 1st St NW to see if I could see the car but could not. I thought about trying to find them in the hospital center but decided against it. I took a few minutes to calm myself down on the sidewalk at the corner of Michigan and 1st St, and with the hope that they would come back and see if I was OK. When they did not, and I was composed enough to keep riding, I continued west on Michigan Ave.\"\\n56658050,6810,Washington,DC,20016,Crash Description,\"Was riding down Mass. Ave (towerd Dupont).

Last week they had thrown an object at a cyclist. The cyclist was being pretty confrontational with the group. Today, 3/23/16, I observed a similar group harassing another cyclist. I also observed one person at the rear of the group reaching down to pick up rocks. I was close to the Rhode Island pedestrian bridge and turned around and crossed the bridge over to the Metro side and alerted an officer.\"\\n56775384,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was riding through a green light on K Street NW, traveling alone, with no cars heading in the same direction, when I approached the intersection and 1st Street NW and a driver took a left turn directly into me on the SE corner of the street.

Once traffic had stopped in both directions for myself and two other cyclists coming the opposite way I began riding across. Once I crossed the midpoint of the intersection the van (who had only apparently seen the 2 cyclists going the other direction) started moving while I was crossing in front of him and hit me with the front driver side of his vehicle. I fell sideways off my bike in front of the vehicle and he braked.\\n56779354,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,I was travelling on my bike west on L st NE. As I approached 4-way intersection I saw one car stop and go through the intersection from 8th street going south. I thought it was my turn since i was already at the intersection and I had the right of way. I saw the second car stop at the sign so I continued through the intersection. The driver of that car didnt see me and came through the intersection and we collided at the front part of her driver side of her car. I am not sure of the exact sequence of my impact but her driver side mirror came off. I think we hit on the front part of her car and I was smacked over to the side of her car making the mirror come off. My right side is where the pain is so I think that is how it happened. Then i fell off my bike (to the back?) and I hit my head on pavement. I had a helmet on. Helmet cracked in the back. Driver stopped and called the police. She kept saying that she did not see me. I couldnt stop or get out of her way b/c it happened so fast. Luckily it was not high speed. I was checked out by EMS and then went to urgent care.\\n56795459,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"Car door opened and pedestrian popped out immediately, with no time foe a reaction. I brushed the pedestrian (who had a cut on her face) and I flew off my bike.\"\\n56804906,6810,washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,Hit and run-Heading eastbound on K in the very right lane and a car pulled out to make left turn and did not see me. There was oncoming traffic so the car was perpendicular to lanes and waiting to cross. Slippery conditions meant that when trying to stop my bike slid out from underneath me and I crashed on the front left side of the car.

I was heading West on Irving St. NW, riding my bike on the sidewalk (which is legal in this area and designated by signage). As I approached the intersection at 1st and Irving (Washington Hospital Center), the cars coming out of the Hospital Center were stopped. I had a green crosswalk light but slowed down because the driver at the intersection had her head turned to the left (she was apparently waiting for the traffic to clear so that she would turn right). She turned her head toward the front, she was still stopped, and my light was still green, so I proceeded through the crosswalk. Just as I started to go, she started turning. I screamed and tried to swerve around the car, but there was nowhere I could go. She hit me and my bike with the right corner of her car, causing me to fall off of my bike, into the rightmost lane of traffic. I fell off of the left side of my bike, which caused bruising on my left ankle, left hand, and right knee. I got up and carried my bike out of the intersection. The first thing the driver told me was that she had a green light (or a right turn signal), and I told her that I had a signal to go across the crosswalk. She asked if I was okay, but did not get out to check on me (even though she is a doctor). I asked for her contact information, and she handed me her business card. Paramedics two cars down came up to me, telling me that they \"\"saw everything\"\" and would help me. They asked if I was hurt. I told them that I was okay but really shaken up. The driver might have asked if she could leave, but the paramedics asked her to stay. I asked the paramedics to call the police so that I could get a police report.\"\\n56825561,6810,Washington,DC,20036,Crash Description,\"SUV suddenly appeared in front of me from right to left - could not stop and sideswiped / was sideswiped by vehicle OR was sideswiped coming from behind, left, to in front, right not sure, that is why I want to speak to police officer.\"\\n56829633,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"My partner (Josh Linden, WABA member) and I were biking south on Florida Ave NW, crossing over Massachusetts Ave NW. After crossing Mass Ave, we got off our bikes and walked on the sidewalk heading south on 23rd St NW, since the Pride Parade was using the streets for staging in advance of the event. We continued walking until we reached the corner of 23rd St NW and P St NW, where we got back on our bikes and turned right, onto the P St bridge, going west. Because the streets were blocked by parade and police vehicles, we got back on our bikes at the crosswalk through the on-ramp to Rock Creek Parkway (north). My partner was in front of me, and rode into the main road, and I followed him. As I was entering the main road (going west), a 4-door sedan, traveling on the wrong (left) side of the road to go around cars in front of him, picked up speed to make a left onto the on-ramp to Rock Creek Parkway. It did not use a turn signal, was on the wrong side of the road, and as it began to turn left, I veered to my right in an attempt to avoid the car while shouting out to the driver. The driver picked up speed while making the left, and crashed directly into me. My bike and I flew onto his hood and windshield, he continued driving for another second before slamming the breaks, which sent me approximately 10-15 feet into the road in front of the car. My wrist was sprained; my right shoulder, right side, right foot, left calf, and left thigh were scraped up; and my bicycle was damaged. Fortunately I was wearing a helmet. After the car struck me and sent me flying into the road, my partner (who had been in front of me, and witnessed the collision) ran back toward the scene. As the driver opened the door and got out, he said nothing and did nothing. There were two passengers in the back seat, indicating that he was likely an Uber or Lyft driver.\"\\n56836248,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"Prior to bike path, driver laid on the horn for a long time until speeding up and almost clipping my back, driving me to the sidewalk.

I was riding straight ahead on the right side of the road...still waiting for bike lanes :(. As often happens at this intersection, a car in the left hand turn lane on Old Courthouse Rd, to turn onto Rt 123, turned left early into the Exxon gas station located on the corner. I was passing in front of the entrance to the gas station when the car hit me at about a 45 deg angle heading toward me from the left. The car hit and smashed my left pedal, pushed my bike out from under me, and kept moving. I landed flat on my back on the road with minor bruises. My head did not hit anything. Judging from how far away the car stopped he probably didn\\'t see me until impact. I was wearing a bright green shirt, riding a bright yellow road bike, and running front and rear lights. Although I realize now that the front light is probably not bright enough (Planet Bike Beamer 1). My mistake was to jump the light across Rt 123 just before the green left turn arrows in my direction activated. I do this to avoid dealing with traffic moving in my lane. The idea is to get across while traffic in my lane is stopped at the light and make my way as fast as possible to Woodford Ave a 1/4 mile up the road. The downside is that this put me out alone on Courthouse Rd in low lighting. The driver of the vehicle involved was nice enough to stop and of course tell me he didn\\'t see me. I was too flustered to ask for info. No other drivers stopped to help. No police on scene. One driver waiting in the left hand turn lane asked if I was OK. I answered affirmative. This happened on my commute home from work which I try to bike 1-2 days a week. I\\'ve been road biking since 1985, have bike commuted within Arlington/Alexandria for 15 years, spent 5 years road biking country roads around New York\\'s Finger Lakes region and 1 year in Seattle while in grad school and this is the first I have ever been hit by a car. My last and only serious crash off of a bike happened in 1994. I consider myself a pretty safe cyclist but am now reconsidering commuting to Tysons Corner, at least in the winter. Why aren\\'t there more bike lanes in this area? Most of the roads have plenty of room and the new Metro stops all have bike racks which encourage cycling. Thanks for your help!\"\\n56926410,6810,Washington,DC,20008,Crash Description,\"As I crossed through the intersection with Columbia Road riding north on 18th street (that then turned into Adams Mill Road), passengers in a dark Saturn Vue threw a can of beer at my back tire. The vehicle sped ahead but was caught at the red light at the intersection of Calvert Street/Adams Mill Road/Lanier Place NW. I rode up to the driver\\'s side window of the car (it was slightly cracked) and heard them laughing. I said \"\"Thanks for throwing your trash at me, asshole\"\" (not my proudest moment I admit) and then after the light turned green, they threw another full, open can of beer at my torso which covered me. A pedestrian saw and yelled at the car. Unfortunately I was too shocked/angry/upset in the moment and didn\\'t get the full license plate. I then rode home to Woodley Park and called the police (911) to report the incident. The officer showed up to my home address quickly but said there was probably nothing they could do because so much time had passed and because I didn\\'t get the full license plate.

She said she turned around when she heard the crash and only saw his car, so she didn\\'t know what happened until I stood up. She also says she never saw him stop.

I lost traction and hit the trail bridge railing, landing hard on the concrete. There is a significant problem with sand and silt from recent flooding all along Rock Creek Park, which poses a major hazard to cyclists. This stretch coming down from Calvert street is particularly treacherous as many bikers pick up speed going downhill as they approach the turn for the trail bridge where the sand has gotten to be 1-2 inches thick. That being said, sand all along the trail has been a recent problem due to flooding and sub par maintenance.

I asked another driver if they could report the this \"\"safety\"\" issue to get a clean-up. The driver said I could call the police and that it was a \"\"government\"\" matter. I asked if he had a first aid kit on the bus and if I could get an ice pack. He said he did not. Really? No first aid kits on a metrobus? (I suspect both of my inquiries required too much paper work and negative safety marks that metro doesn\\'t need right now.) I did not call the police.

I asked for us to meet at a nearby side street to call police, get a report, and exchange insurance information. We met on U Street SE, just off MLK Blvd SE.

I stopped at the red light with my left foot planted on the ground. Out of nowhere, I felt a car wheel run my left foot over. I yelled and saw that it was the car that had been honking at me. The driver was staring directly at me. I yelled \"\"What the f** are you doing?\"\" At this point, the driver a man likely in his 50s with a short haircut and smoking cigarette, jumped out of his car and got in my face yelling at me. He initially stated that it was my fault because I was not in a bike lane. I said that I didn\\'t need to be in a bike lane and asked him why he ran my foot over. He continued to insult me and to stand chest-to-chest with me. I asked him why he ran my foot over again and he pulled out a badge, informed me that he was a police officer, and dared me to do something. By this time, three witness (DC kickball players on a green team walking back from a game) had run up and were yelling that they had seen it. The driver mistakenly thought that the witnesses were coming to his defense. He yelled \"\"See there! Three perfect witnesses!\"\" One of the witnesses came over and said \"\"yes, we saw you run that guys foot over and then pull out your badge\"\" and yelled at the driver for abusing his power. At this point, the driver\\'s demeanor changed dramatically and he began to yell things like \"\"so what?\"\" and \"\"what do you fucking want?\"\" instead of yelling that it was my fault. I, again, asked him why he ran my foot over. At this point he began saying that he was not paying attention. I asked him why he pulled out his badge. He told me that it was just an accident--\"\"these things just happen.\"\" He offered to pay for any damage to my bike if I could show him any. He offered to call an ambulance or the police, again reminding me that he was an off-duty police officer. I took down his license plate number. I told him that he needed to pay attention. Another biker pointed out that the damage he could do to a biker was substantial. Several of the witnesses yelled at the driver for pulling out his badge and trying to intimidate me.

About half of them had made it through the intersection (heading north on 1st) when the light changed, and someone in the group stopped in the middle of the intersection to keep the cars on both sides of Fl from going even though we had the green light. When cars started honking at the bikers, who were clearly in the wrong, they all started whooping, shouting, and throwing middle fingers towards the honking cars. I don\\'t know if you all have any way of finding out who organized the ride, but as someone that bikes everyday, I was embarrassed for the biking community and understood why we often get such a bad rap.

I biked across the potholes and then as I came into the intersection of 6th St SE and Independence Ave SE, the front wheel on the Capital Bikeshare bike that I was riding just completely seized and I went flying across the handlebars. I flew over the bike across the handlebars, was completely airborne, and landed in the intersection hitting my knees, hips, stomach, chest, arms, and palms on the pavement. Two cyclists who were biking behind me stopped and helped me find my glasses and move the bike to the curb. I quickly checked to make sure there were no obvious serious injuries like bleeding profusely, then called my husband to pick me up and drop off the Capital Bikeshare bike. It turns out that the Capital Bikeshare bike malfunctioned because the fender stay (the wire that holds the fender in place) of the front wheel became loose and the fender stay wire dug into the groove of the front wheel, which caused the wheel to stop turning and me to fly over the handlebars into the intersection. As i was riding over the potholes, the bike was rattling quite a bit and i think that may have caused the wire to come loose. That block on 6th Street SE, just south of Independence Ave SE, is incredibly dangerous and needs to be fixed ASAP.

When the door struck me my bike hit the ground and I landed on my knees. I was between the cab and a parked car, which prevented me from falling. I may have fallen onto the parked car, but I am unsure. Two people on the sidewalk asked if I was OK and if I was dizzy.

Visibility was not very good. There were a lot of cars on the road and they were using their headlights—which were aimed into my eyes. On some level, I suppose I should be embarrassed by the accident, but feel it is important to report this: I simply rode straight into the back side of a large \"\"Road Work Ahead\"\" sign that had been placed directly in the middle of the bike trail. (The sign had extra weights slung around the bottom to keep it in place.) I got bruised a bit, but that\\'s about it. I could have veered off onto the road, which was only two feet away, but thankfully did not. The back side of these signs are gray and barely visible to the naked eye on a good night. On a bad night they\\'re hard to see at all. To complicate the situation further—this sign was not there when I passed by the location on my commute to the Vienna Metro station earlier in the day. I had no idea it was there and I absolutely wasn\\'t expecting it! Since then an army of these signs has been marching steadily eastward as a repaving project has commenced.

In an otherwise very courteous group of cars, a Lincoln SUV driver with VA plates started honking repeatedly and, once she caught up to me, yelled out the window for me to \"\"get off the road!\"\" before turning onto Idylwood.\"\\n57918311,6810,Arlington,VA,22206,Crash Description,\"I was riding Northbound and uphill on the 11th St. bike lane, and there was a vehicle double-parked on the bike lane. I looked behind my shoulder and saw no cars coming, so I moved into the traffic lane to pass the double-parked vehicle. As I was moving back into the bike lane, a car struck me on my butt from behind. I was hit quite hard, my butt still hurts the next day and my back hurt, but somehow I managed to not fall over and keep riding. Of course the driver sped up, but I caught him at the next traffic light, after crossing Rhode Island Ave. I confronted him and he, an African American man in his 20s or 30s with dreadlocks, about 5\\'9\"\", threatened to harm me.\"\\n57918978,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"I moved into the center lane to pass 2 cars waiting to make a right hand turn, and I heard a vehicle accelerate behind me (I had looked before switching lanes, and there was adequate space). The driver then rapidly passed me, not moving over at all, so I veered into the stationary car on the right. At the next light, he rolled down his window and screamed, \"\"Stupid fucking bitch!!\"\"\"\\n57935929,6810,Silver Spring,MD,20902,Crash Description,\"Was on a straight section of road, saw vehicle approaching from a distance in my mirror.

I passed the vehicle having it on my right when it suddenly attempted to conduct an illegal u-turn crossing double yellow lines. The driver hit my bike and I fell over without getting injured. I called the police which took a report. The report included contradictory reports from the driver (who denied) and I so the police will not pursue it.

I saw that the white SUV in that lane had left quite a gap and remember being pleasantly surprised.

When I caught up to the driver at the next light he said something to the effect of I shouldn\\'t have been on the road and he should have hit me. I don\\'t remember the exact words because I was angry myself. I then told him I was going to report it to the police and asked him to stick around for it.

The vehicle was traveling approximately 40-45 mph. It was about 0645 on a Saturday morning when I was hit and there was hardly any traffic on the road.

Union St shareway bike route to Mt. Vernon. An Audi SUV was approaching the intersection from Prince street. The driver of the SUV began making threatening gestures and shaking fists at us as we traversed the intersection. When we were 200 ft or so past the intersection the SUV aggressively accelerated towards our travel location and, as it got very close to us, crowded our lane and then made a final sudden move towards our position, forcing us to attempt evasive actions to protect ourselves. Something brushed my back wheel (it’s possible it was his car door or my wife’s bike) but I was able to retain my balance and ended up stopping a few feet in front and to the right of the SUV. However my wife crashed to the roadway. I did aggressively move to block the SUV\\'s exit path as he started to pull forward while my wife was on the ground next to his vehicle. He then exited his vehicle and said that I would never be able prove he actually hit her - we exchanged words while waiting for the police and ambulance to arrive but had no further contact.\"\\n58187311,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was biking down I St toward 11th in the main lane (not in the bike lane that goes in the opposite direction). The motorist opened the door and said she hadn\\'t seen me in the rear view mirror (which appeared to already be broken). A friend of mine had just passed ahead of me, so I guess the driver didn\\'t see her either. The motorist asked why I wasn\\'t in the bike lane (which is for the opposite direction) but then apologized.\"\\n58217007,6810,Washington,DC,20012,Crash Description,\"I was traveling straight, and a driver turned right suddenly in front of me into what I think was a parking garage.

A parked sedan directly in front of me opened its door. I caught the outside edge of the door, which pushed me over into another sedan a few feet away that was sitting at a red light. I hit (and took off) the second sedan\\'s right side mirror, probably hit my front wheel on his tire (couldn\\'t see this, but assume based on damage done to wheel), and flipped over my handlebars into the street.\"\\n58247605,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was riding south in the right lane of Connecticut. Driver was driving north on Connecticut and turned left (west) on to Woodley, and clipped my back frame and wheel. She tried to leave, but saw me taking pictures of her car. Police were across the street (attending a different accident). We walked over, and they didn\\'t want to file a report because I wasn\\'t injured. The driver claimed \"\"I didn\\'t see her!\"\" (to the police). Later, she told her insurance company she had a green arrow and I ran a red (I had a green light), and she refused to replace my bike. Oh drivers.\"\\n58247883,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"It was a red light at the intersection, we were both traveling east on Q street NW. She did not have a signal on, but the front of her car was nudging to the right as if she was going to turn when the light changed. She was still in the middle of the driving lane, so she was appearing to wait until the light changed to proceed with the turn. I rolled into the cross walk to assert my presence and was 1-2 seconds away from being completely stopped myself when she hit the gas, fast, and went right into me (light was still red). My back wheel went under her car and I was taken off the bike on the right side. I honestly can\\'t say if it was her car that thrust me off or if I jumped or both. Once I stood up, I looked back and she said \"\"do you want me to pull over?\"\" I was surprised she asked but said \"\"Yes please.\"\" And then I kind of lost it. I called 911 and the dispatcher told me I did not need an officer if i didn\\'t need an ambulance. She asked if I needed an ambulance, not if I was injured. So I said no. She told me to just get her insurance information. I took a picture of her insurance papers, which she presented to me like this happens to her all of the time, and then she took off. There was 1 witness, but I couldn\\'t get him to stay either. He said he only saw my fall but didn\\'t see me get hit.

THe driver failed to see me although I had crossed his full field of vision and he made a right turn at the intersection and hit just behimd my leg at the rear bike tire sending me off to the side and forward hitting my head shoulder and knees on the pavement. The motorist did stop and give me contact information and check to see if i was ok. I did not have my phone on me so I could not contact ambulance.

Just ahead and driving parallel was a pickup truck. With me not far behind, he started to turn right into the parking lot of the McCormick Paints. I didn\\'t realize he didn\\'t see me, and I wasn\\'t able to stop in time--my brakes did not work perfectly. As he turned right, I collided with the right side of the truck, and as I was knocked off the bike, his right rear tire rolled over my foot. The next thing I remember, I was sitting on the sidewalk with my bike (with a bent fork) propped up on a trash can next to me. The driver did stop and get out of his truck once he had fully rolled into the parking lot. My shoe (a flat) had flown off, so my bare foot was between the tire and the pavement, and my foot was scraped and very swollen/purple. Other than that, I wasn\\'t sure yet how badly I was injured, so I just sat on the sidewalk for a while waiting for the shock to pass. In my dazed state, I assumed that the crash was entirely my fault because I was the one who had struck the truck, but I have since come to understand that in a \"\"right hook\"\" situation the driver is at least partly responsible.\"\\n58382275,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"Biking in bike lane between cars parked on curb to the right and moving lanes to the left.

The second biker rode right into her, but was able to brake a bit more to brace for the collision. A really nice bystander grabbed the first woman and her bike and carried them onto the sidewalk to check she was ok and try to fix her bike. The driver was incredibly apologetic and stunned. I heard the first bicyclist say that he really needs to check the street before opening his door, especially on 18th St. The second biker carried his bike onto the sidewalk and walked it home, or at least away from the scene. I heard the bystander talking to the first cyclist and tell her, \"\"it was a good thing you were wearing your helmet.\"\" From my view, directly across the street from the car, about to cross to unlock my own bike, I can attest that had she not been wearing her helmet she would\\'ve been in much worse shape.\"\\n58382459,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,I was heading west on Penn in the middle track approaching 7th ST NW on my right.

As we approached the stop sign, the driver continued to tap the gas to accelerate right up to me. As we got to the sign, I stopped and as I turned around to ask the driver if he was planning on hitting me, he in fact did hit me, rear-ended me, pinching my fender onto my tire and blowing out the sidewall on my tire.

Several cars stopped at a crosswalk ahead of me. As I reached the third car in line, the passenger door opened directly in front of me. The corner of the door pierced my chest on the upper left side. I didn\\'t fall off the bike - I wasn\\'t traveling quickly. I was prepared to accept an apology and go on my way, when I realized I was bleeding profusely. At that point, I calmly asked the driver for her insurance information. She told her passenger to get back in the car, and, the other cars having now moved on, drove quickly away. I repeated the license number to myself until I was able to write it down. Some people eating outside at a nearby restaurant came to help me.

Halfway up the hill I looked back and saw a pickup truck on the downhill. I made a left turn signal with my arm and was closely watching the left lane for any oncoming traffic, as visibility was extremely limited since the crest of the hill was not far away. I made my left turn, having been unaware that the pickup truck had crossed the solid double yellow lines in a dangerous attempt to overtake me. He struck me in the center of the left lane.

Althought this driver should have stopped at the stop sign, he seemed to be gliding down Taylor Street. I slowed down slightly but continued moving. While passing Taylor Street, the driver did not stop at the stop sign and I quickly realized I was going to be hit. I swirved as best I could, to the left but the driver hit me on my right side. After being hit by the car, I fell to the left and landed in the middle of the road. The driver paused only for a second or two before driving away, thus committing a hit and run. A car driving the opposite way I was, on Arkansas, turned around and followed the minivan that hit me. To my knowledge, it was this driver, who called the police with the license plate number of the driver who hit me. I was left alone in the middle of the street. A woman in her home, heard me scream and came outside offering to let me come inside to call the police and report the incident. I declined and picked up my bike, which was contorted at this point, and moved to the side walk. I called the police to report the incident at 9:41 PM.

I was knocked sideways, but not off my bike. The cab driver did not stop and continued driving away down I Street. I did a quick check and determined that I was okay and that my bike appeared safe to ride, so I took off after him down I Street to get his cab number and license number. He stopped at a red light at 12th and I streets NW, and I pulled up beside him to note his license number and cab number. I yelled at him through the window that he hit me. He denied it, and accused me of hitting his car and slapping it with my hand to make a noise. I repeated that he hit my bike with his car, and this time he\\'d responded that he had his turn signal on and he had a right to go. I believe he was preparing to drive away again when a car pulled up beside him and blocked him from driving away.

The cab driver continued to deny it until the other car\\'s driver pulled out a badge (he turned out to be an off-duty security officer), at which point he started apologizing. The security guard made sure I was okay and that I had the cab driver\\'s information, and I snapped a couple of photos of the car and got the plate number. The security officer gave me his business card and drove away. I was getting ready to walk away after that to lock my bike up and calm down (I was about a block away from my office) before deciding whether to call the police to file a report when the cab driver got out of my car and said he wanted to talk. I said I really didn\\'t want to talk to him right then, but he insisted and said he wanted to give me his information. He didn\\'t have a card, so I handed him the security guard\\'s business card and said he should write his name and number on the back. He asked for my information, but I didn\\'t feel comfortable giving him my name or my number given that he\\'d been behaving really weirdly the whole time. I told him I wouldn\\'t give him my information, and he held onto the security guard\\'s card with his information written on it and asked me for my information again. I could see he was thinking about taking the card and walking away, so I told him to give me the card and kept repeating that, pointing out that I already had photos of his car and his license number, so it would not be to his benefit to refuse to give the card back. He scratched out half his information and handed the card back to me and tried to get a photo of me with his phone. I walked back to my office, where I promptly called the the police to file a report.\"\\n59322717,6810,washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I heard a very loud sound or two cars colliding.

At one point, someone came out of s nearer house and brought a blanket. Once ambulance and police arrived a few minutes later, after the paramedics were at work either treating or collecting remains of whoever was on the pavement, the officer was walking around investigating, and at one point retrieved a damaged bicycle from near the victim.

Police/Ambulance were called and I was taken to a local hospital. I have some scrapes and bruises, and a pretty nasty concussion as a result. I was given a warning citation for \"\"Pedestrian entering intersection in disregard of approaching traffic\"\".

In the intersection a yellow car that I had passed while stopped turned right into me (I was trying to go straight).

There was a tan sedan waiting to make a right hand turn. The arrows were green for traffic on King Street going east and westbound, and the pedestrian indicator was giving clearance to pedestrians crossing S. 28th Street as well. The driver (white woman in her 20s/30s, blonde hair) made a right turn as I was entering the crosswalk. She did not go fast and stopped rather quickly, but not after hitting my bike. I pulled by bike back to the crosswalk and collected myself. I was more shocked than anything else that she possibly couldn\\'t have seen me (I was moving slowly and wearing a red shirt).Note, she should have never been turning because her turn was restricted by the \"\"No Right On Red When Pedestrians Are Present\"\" sign at the intersection.\"\\n59435968,6810,Washington,DC,20037,Crash Description,\"I can explain in more detail in a follow up phone call or email if needed.

He continued to verbally threaten me then got out of his vehicle, let out his told whom he commanded to attack me. He then grabbed a large stick and tried to hit me with it. I flinched at his perceived attack and then he slapped my phone out of my hand. I called the police to the scene and also a neighbor described the incident as they had seen it occur. I feel the police that arrived at the scene didn’t treat it fairly and I felt as though it was not handled properly. The motorist claimed I damaged his car even though I did not. He apparently showed the “damage” to the police and after that I was treated as though I were a threat even though he was the one who attacked me.\"\\n59446930,6810,WASHINGTON,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was riding eastbound in the bike lane on F St. NW between the National Building Museum and the Judiciary Square Metrorail Station plaza.

He continued to honk and shout (he was in his car and I could not hear what he was saying) for over a minute - I stood still - and then pulled into the middle of the intersection and flicked me off. Two pedestrians who witnessed the incident told me that they had just seen him \"\"chasing\"\" another bicyclist on Yuma and that he had run a stop sign at the last intersection in order to follow the bicyclist. I do not know what precipitated the interaction between the other bicyclist and the car but he was extremely aggressive and angry and I was very concerned that he was going to run me down as I was standing at the intersection.\"\\n59465606,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,I was biking down Massachusetts Ave going east passing by the Marriott Marquis when the pickup truck in front of me suddenly hit the breaks and I crashed into the back of the truck.

Bystanders took the bike off me and I sat there trying to regain my breath and see if I could move my hand and other limbs. The driver immediately got out of the car and came next to me, holding onto my right hand. Eventually I was able to stand and move off the road so the driver could move her car off the road and not block traffic. I had a bad scrape on my right elbow and scrapes on my knees. The adrenaline made it so I couldn\\'t feel how sore I was, and didn\\'t realize the extent of my hand injury. She repeatedly admitted fault on the scene saying she was so sorry and wouldn\\'t dispute anything. She offered to just give me her own bike and pay for things out of pocket.

Another woman from a nearby office came with a first aid kit and told the driver that the turn she made was illegal. The driver said she hadn\\'t known that.

I fell down on the crosswalk across 11 St NW, my head striking the ground (I was wearing a helmet). I immediately got up and took a picture of the vehicle\\'s license plate. The driver of the vehicle did not get out of the car, though said through the window, \"\"I didn\\'t see you!\"\" A nearby construction worker walked over and asked the driver of the vehicle to move out of the intersection and pull to the side. At that time, the driver fled the scene, northbound on 11th St NW.\"\\n59698293,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,I was traveling west on Pennsylvania Avenue.

I was about to go through the intersection of irving and 11th when the car ahead of me to the left turned right sharply to 11th street. My front tire hit his car and I fell into his passenger side door. The driver pulled over right away, got out and asked if I was ok. After I confirmed that I was, we exchanged information and left.\"\\n59756646,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I was riding in the far right lane (out of four total) on Independence Ave SW heading east towards Washington Ave SW. I was riding in the middle of the lane; few cars were on the road; and no cars were parked along the side. I was riding upright wearing a bright shirt on a road bike with a rear reflector and rear blinking red LED, no helmet. I thought I heard a car following closely, and I turned my head in time in order to make eye contract with the the driver of a red Hyundai Solaris in my lane approaching fast. She drove straight into my bicycle from behind, and I was thrown off the bike on onto the roadway, landing on my right side. I was able to get up and move to the sidewalk. The driver then pulled up a little farther and shouted out the window \"\"Why are you over here?!\"\" and \"\"You are supposed to be over there!\"\", indicating to the sidewalk. She then pulled past my bike (still in the road) and pulled to the side in front of me. The Capitol police are always stationed at that intersection (accident happened halfway up the block before the intersection though), and a cop walked to the scene. Several officers in cars and motorcycles joined within a minute or two. The car had a mark on the front bumper from my tire, and she was a issued a ticket for \"\"failure to control speed\"\". She lied to the police however, trying to say that I darted in front of her somehow...? Even though I\\'d been established in the lane for several hundred feet. The rear tire of the bicycle is clearly mangled. I locked it up and metroed home. Will call insurance tomorrow and get the bike looked at ASAP, as well as paying close attention to any injuries. I understand that accidents happen, but I was particularly disappointed that she did not even ask \"\"Are you OK?\"\" and then lied to the police. I received a copy of the police report number.\"\\n59840157,6810,arlington,VA,22204,Crash Description,\"At m st & wisc eastbound at 11.20ish am, pulled thru big black suv up to two racing type bikes in front of cars, lots of pedestrians, including one guy walking between cars before the intersection, maybe panhandling.

I was going straight, but watching it to see if it put on a turn signal so I could slow down. The driver never put on his turn signal, but took a right anyways right across me. I was paying attention, but still got brushed by the car and had to push off the car and brake hard to avoid falling. The guy was unapologetic and accused me of not having MY turn signal on (even though I was going straight). We need a mobile app that can allow bikers to take pics of these cars and license plates so as to create a database of repeat offenders to share with police. The next time this guy does this he could kill someone.\"\\n59902366,6810,Arlington,VA,22203,Crash Description,\"Wheel caught in gap of metro grate to road, I was launched over handlebars and landed in the middle of the intersection with a broken nose and concussion.\"\\n59943347,6810,Silver Spring,MD,20910,Crash Description,\"I was biking north in the 14th street bike lane, approaching the intersection before Spring Street (14th and Perry), when I noticed a white 16-passenger van encroaching on the bike lane from the traffic lane on the left. Knowing that sometimes drivers sometimes don\\'t notice the bike lane and just drift over into it, I looked for a turn signal, and did not see one. As the van continued moving to the right and further into the bike lane, I began yelling \"\"Bike! Bike! Bike!\"\" - louder as I noticed the wheels starting to turn decisively right. The driver never stopped or slowed in the turn. My left shoulder struck the rearview mirror and my body/bike struck the vehicle underneath the rearview mirror. I was thrown from my bike onto the ground - hitting first my right knee and elbow/wrist, then rolling onto my left shoulder blade. I stood up, and nothing appeared immediately broken. Not knowing if I was okay, I sat on the curb, and a bystander who had been crossing the street called an ambulance. The van driver got out of the van and tried to pull my bike to the curb, but the front right tire of the van was on top of the front bike wheel. The driver had to put the van into reverse to remove the bike tire from underneath its wheel. The driver then pulled the bike out of street. At this time, an un-uniformed DC policeman had pulled up behind the accident.\"\\n59944447,6810,Arlington,VA,22203,Crash Description,A contractor van and I were both on the Key Bridge headed toward Georgetown (I was on the bike path).

The video records their words, faces, language, car and license plates. Please use it to help denounce the abuse.\"\\n59975084,6810,Arlington,VA,22204,Crash Description,\"Not a crash, but a harassment - I was riding eastbound in the bike lane on the left side of this one-way street, and a big BMW was driving in front of me and to the right in the middle of the street. The car driver was an SEC employee who was going to park in the SEC\\'s parking garage, which has its entrance near the corner of 2nd & F NE, on the left-hand-side of F St. As is so often the case here, the car driver didn\\'t bother to look or signal before cutting across the bike lane to enter the parking garage, and cut me off. I was able to avoid making contact with his car, and when I rode by him I told him to look and signal next time. He responded \"\"what are you going to do about it?\"\" and threatened to get our of his car to \"\"resolve\"\" the situation. I\\'m reporting this because while the driver\\'s behavior was typically selfish for this location regarding the bike lane and getting to the parking garage, but atypically hostile and threatening. I get cut off there every now and then (given prior experiences there I\\'m very vigilant about being cut off at that location, so I\\'m usually able to avoid being cut off there these days) but I don\\'t normally get threatened by the driver after they cut me off.\"\\n59976246,6810,BETHESDA,MD,20817,Crash Description,Passenger opened right side door at stop light. Did not look or respond to my warning shout. I braked but could not avoid impact. Hit by trailing edge of door to neck and fell.\\n59985362,6810,Washington,DC,20018,Crash Description,\"I was coming home on my standard commute route that I do five days a week. I had just come up 8th Street NE from the MBT and turned on Monroe Street heading East. I was riding in the bike lane with my strobe headlight flashing. Being that the first half of that block is uphill, I was going a very moderate speed. I passed a long line of cars as I approached the intersection of Monroe and 9th street NE. The light was green and I began to enter the intersection to cross 9th street. Just as I entered the intersection an SUV in the motorist turned right right in front of me without signaling or giving any indication she was intending to do so. To avoid being hit by her, I hit my brakes and swerved hard right onto 9th street NE. Though I was successful in avoiding a collision with her car, my bike went out from under me and I fell onto the street, skidding along on my right side for a few feet. The car stopped a ways down the block and two women got out. The driver said that she: hadn\\'t seen me at all, had no idea what had happened until her mother (the passenger) told her that she had \"\"hit someone back there\"\". Immediately a man ran up to me saying that he had seen the crash and would act as a witness. As, I was in the process of dealing with the two women from the car, I handed the man my cell phone and asked him to put his number in. (unfortunately, I have not been able to locate his information in my phone...) I had sustained substantial lacerations on my right ankle, right knee, right hip and my right elbow. I had blood streaming down my leg and my arm. My handlebars had been turned so hard that they were jammed and stuck on top of my top tube. My water bottle had flown out of it\\'s holder and was no where to be found and my back fender had been torn off the bike. I immediately took a picture of the driver\\'s license plate and informed them that I was going to call the police so that they could make a report of the incident. The driver informed me that she had \"\"just gotten her license back\"\". I apologized and said that I had to call the police simply to have a record of the incident. About 25 min later, Officer T.R. Brown (Fifth District, Badge #5022) arrived on the scene. Throughout the entire process, it seemed as though the officer wasn\\'t quite sure what he was supposed to do. He took a brief statement from me and one from the driver. He then walked to the corner and called someone on his cell phone. He stood there talking on his cell phone for a good 10 min before returning to ask the driver and I for our ID\\'s, insurance information, etc. Eventually, he told us that we could leave and gave me his card and told me to go to the station the next day to get the report. I asked if I could have the insurance information of the driver and he told me it would \"\"all be in the report\"\". About an hour later, the officer called me at home and asked me to go over the details of the crash again with him. At that point he informed me that, \"\"since there was no actually collision\"\" between my bicycle and the vehicle, they would not be filing a police report at all. As he described the incident, I had simply \"\"fallen off my bike\"\". He went on to tell me that if I had in fact made contact with the woman\\'s car, he would have written me a citation. When I insisted that a report be filed, he told me that if I insisted, he would only to be able to file a \"\"miscellaneous\"\" report and that it would not be classified as a traffic accident. Once again I protested, citing that I was both injured and possibly had damage done to my bike, and I demanded that there be an official record of the event. He then told me that I should come down to the Fifth District station and discuss it further with him and his sergeant. I went down to the station at 7:45pm. When I arrived, the officer at the reception window said that he didn\\'t know who the officer was and that the sergeant was not currently there. I attempted to call Officer brown on the cell phone that he called me on, but it went straight to voicemail. Finally, they were able to contact the sergeant, who came into the station at around 8:05pm. He once again took my statement. The two officers then told me that they would be filing an accident (non-collision) report, but that they would not be able to designate who was at fault in the situation due to the fact that it was my word against hers and I had not been able to produce any witnesses. I went over the events again with the two officers\"\\n59986448,6810,Washington,DC,20008,Crash Description,\"On my commute home from work this past Thursday, 9/15, I was hit by another biker who was flying downhill in the wrong lanes (into oncoming traffic to avoid waiting at the light in his lanes) at P St. and 23rd St. NW. I have the police report with statements from a few witnesses, including the biker behind me, who all confirmed that I yelled out to the other biker, swerved, and braked before being hit by him at full speed. Since he did not slow down and was larger than me, I took most of the force from the head-on collision, and he landed on top of me. My right foot got jammed between his wheel and the frame, which is what stopped his bike and twisted my knee. He slammed the top of his head (no helmet) into my jaw, but was fine and did not need medical treatment, except a bandaid for a small scrape on his fingertip. He tried to pull his bike off of my leg to ride away, but luckily another biker behind me stopped him from breaking my leg and running away. Finally a driver was able to pick up both me and his bike and separate us. One of the witnesses was a nurse who was able to help until the police and EMTs arrived.\"\\n59994390,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"On Saturday afternoon, I was biking down H St. (between 12th and 13th), and my tire got caught in the lightrail track, causing me to collide forcefully into a parked car, and then fall. Other than some scrapes and bruises, I was fine. There was some damage to the car\\'s bumper, however. The car owner returned to her car shortly after, and her friends pushed the bumper back into place, but I gave her my info in case. She now says the bumper needs to be replaced, and she refuses to go through her insurance, asking that I write her a check to cover all costs (estimated at $850 from the auto body shop).\"\\n59995920,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,driver opened door of parked car on my right just as I passed it.

A vehicle (Hyundai Tucson) approached the intersection and prepared to make a right turn onto westbound S Four Mile Run Dr, which parallels the W&OD. The vehicle had a red light and I had the walk light. I saw the car stop, so I continued across the intersection. The vehicle the proceeded to make the right turn on red and cross in front of me. I was unable to stop and we collided.\"\\n60109521,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"This morning, I was biking down 21st Street on my way to work. I had a green light as I crossed the intersection at M Street in the right lane. As I was mid-intersection, a DC metro bus on M Street turned right on to 21st St. (Did the bus turn on a red light or do they have an arrow?) The bus blocked all of the right lane, so I got into the middle lane. Just as I was getting into the middle lane, a taxi (dark green, I think) pulled in front of me from the right lane. (The taxi might have come from behind the bus and came into the middle lane because the bus was stopped.) The taxi cut me off, so I had to get over into the left lane. Right as I was getting into the left lane, I saw a gigantic pothole in front of me. It was too soon to swerve, so I had to slam on my breaks. I hit the pothole and flew over my handlebars into the street. 3 women came over to help me. One of the women (Anika?) worked for the DC Golden Triangle and called an ambulance for me. She said that the potholes were a huge problem and she\\'s been trying to get them fixed for months. She told me that she has seen other cyclists fall on them and even dignitaries will trip on them as they cross the street. I got taken to Georgetown University Hospital in an ambulance, after the EMTs concluded I was hurt pretty badly.\"\\n60115758,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"I (the cyclist) was traveling west on Florida Avenue and stopped at the light at 9th St NW, in the right turn only lane. After looking right and then left, it appeared safe to turn. I turned right, intending to proceed north on 9th in the far right lane. However, a car traveling south on 9th street attempted to cut the corner while making a left turn onto Florida Ave. The car cut across the double yellow line and at least one opposing traffic lane, hitting me head-on as I turned the corner. I was thrown into the windshield and landed in the middle of the intersection. Pedestrians assisted me and diverted traffic until police and EMTs arrived.\"\\n60195436,6810,Arlington,VA,22207,Crash Description,\"Cyclist was heading east on M street at the Wharf on the wide sidewalk designed for pedestrian and bicycle use. She came upon an entrance to the fish market. The driveway was obstructed by an illegally parked truck. When she entered the drive, she came into conflict with an SUV that was exiting the market onto M Street. I didn\\'t see the actual conflict, but it was apparent from the driver\\'s statement to me and from the scene (no collision) that he approached M street slowly, possibly even safely. However, there was too little time for the cyclist to react; she ditched and fell onto the concrete hard. In addition to a possible mistake by the driver (unsure), a contributing cause to the accident was the parked truck, obstructing a view that is necessary for both pedestrians and cyclists to cross safely. This is a daily occurrence at these wharf/fish market intersections. Trucks block the views. I recommend that WABA and the DC Government do the following: (1) survey the site and see what additional protections can be offered to cyclists. A mini bike zone could be painted on the sidewalk to avoid conflicts with pedestrians. Perhaps some of those flexible barriers could be added on the street. There is a flow of bikes from the Jefferson memorial bike path into Southwest here, yet no clear lane for bikes. The parking lots to the fish market and marina need signs warning cars of crossing bikes and pedestrians. These are easy and cheap fixes as there is adequate space. (2) The government needs to install concrete posts near the driveway entrances/exits to M street so that it is not possible for trucks to pull all the way up to the sidewalk A 10\\' berth would still allow for unloading and loading but preserve sight lines. I cross through every day and it\\'s unnecessarily dangerous. For $10,000, this area could become much safer.\"\\n60239827,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"I was biking in the right lane and a cab tried to pull an illegal u turn from the right lane across all 4 lanes of traffic , didn\\'t see me and I smashed into the side\"\\n60240660,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"I was riding south down 14th street in right lane headed straight through a green light. Woman in 4 door sedan (VA license plate 4vrchg) attempted a left turn from oncoming traffic (heading north on 14th st turning west onto Florida). I yelled just before she struck me going through the beginning of the intersection. I flew over my handle bars, onto and across her hood, and thankfully landed on my feet. I exclaimed \"\"What were you trying to do?\"\" with no reply. I hobbled over to my broken bike and picked it up as I sat on the curb. She quickly asked if I was okay to which I replied \"\"I don\\'t know, I think so....\"\" Witnesses walking on the sidewalk and in other cars stopped to make sure and ask further if I was alright as the woman who struck me drove off hurriedly. in shock, I walked into the middle of the street and memorized her license plate number. Before answering any other questions I wrote it down in my phone so as not to forget. With the help of the witnesses, police arrived within minutes and a full report of Hit and Run was filed with 2 eye witness accounts and the officer made note of a couple cameras on the side of the building adjacent to the crime. Investigation is ongoing.\"\\n60270034,6810,Bethesda,MD,20814,Crash Description,\"No crash. It was on a residential 25 mph street with lots of room ... no cars parked to make the two wide lanes narrow ... no reason at all for this. My friend and I were riding along at 18-20mph ... the dude in the Mini apparently pulled up alongside him and I heard my friend yelling \\'3 feet 3 feet\\' as in the proper car-bike passing distance. The driver was trying to intimidate him ... What happened next is the worst part: the driver accelerated toward me and passed me at higher speed (35mph?) just inches to my left. All on a street with the entire other lane open, and I was probably 3 feet off the curb. I stay farther right than many cyclists ... My friend saw this unfold in front of him and was actually much angrier than me, because of seeing the acceleration I suppose. He saw the acceleration and knew the danger of this. The driver of course stopped at a Red Light two blocks down the road and when I pulled out my phone and said I was calling 911 he got out of the car for some reason. Long story short: The driver waited many 30 minutes for Police, and my friend and I waited for 1 1/2 hours. No police came and I called the next day. Today, more than a week later, all I will say is that 911 has been slow in managing this. An officer came out and took the story the next day and said all he could do was talk to the driver once he got the license # from 911. Unfortunately 911 gave him the wrong #, he said no such plate exists, and drove away. I called 911 and they listened to my call again and realized they had given him the wrong tag #. I had also driven to the street where this driver had come out from, and his car was parked there. But it was too late ... the officer had left my house 15 minutes before but I would have to have a whole second round of cop cars pull up in front of my house, and repeat my story to a new cop. Amazing. And why three cop cars had to come to my house when I am the victim is beyond me. I don\\'t know what my neighbors think. I work four part time jobs to afford to live in Bethesda, and scheduling a window for a 2nd officer visit has been difficult. I called today and was told the initial responding officer can call me back .... why that didn\\'t happen 15 minutes after our initial statement is beyond me. I don\\'t want multiple police cruisers pulling up in front of my house again... Hopefully I will get a call from the initial officer who was good, and the aggressive driver will be spoken to .... that is apparently all they can do.\"\\n60273643,6810,Takoma Park,MD,20912,Crash Description,\"I was headed northbound towards F St NW (in the street, in the right lane), and the car was across from me, southbound, turning left onto I-66.

The car then started moving in closer to me and then made a sudden turn into the IMF parking garage hitting me with the front right bumper, striking me in the knee. I was able to recover and was not seriously injured and there was no damage done to either myself or my bike or the motorists car. Though the driver claims a completly different accoutn of the events and claims I hit her door of the car to which this is physically impossible and furthermore there is no evidence of such an encounter. The police decided to believe her over me and issue me a \"\"fail to yield to another vehicle\"\" ticket.\"\\n60469815,6810,Arlington,VA,22202,Crash Description,While making the right turn onto the Mt Vernon trail the bike slipped and I fell to the left with my shoulder taking the brunt of the impact.\\n60470506,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was biking in the bike path (AND HAD RIGHT OF WAY). The car wanted to leave the wharf area and merge into traffic on Maine Ave. They have a stop sign before crossing the bikepath but pulled out directly in front of me. I saw that she pulled out but assumed that meant that she would continue into traffic, but she stopped directly in front of me blocking the bike path. I tried to swerve to avoid hitting her, and I was partially successful so I didn\\'t hit the car directly, but instead bounced off the trunk and fell off my bike.\"\\n60490799,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was riding on the right side of the south-flowing traffic, which was backed up at the Mt Pleasant stoplight.

As I approached the intersection I saw the front of the MetroAccess vehicle. Assuming he would yield to my right of way, I kept going. The vehicle then started its left turn. By then it was too late to react by braking, so I swerved left. My right side made contact with the left bumper of the vehicle, then I fell to my left. I sustained bruising to my left fingers and wrist. My bicycle is no longer rideable, as the gears and wheels are jammed. I pulled my bicycle to the side of the road as quickly as possible, and was told by the driver that we had to wait for his supervisor to file the report. He said the supervisor would arrive within 10 minutes. I had to wait over 90. As I provided my statement, the supervisor took photographs of myself and the bicycle. He asked me to then verbally state what happened. Over the course of this time the driver (while he was relieved that I was ok) said he assumed I would stop at the intersection because he thought he saw me. He also explained that because it was a green light he also had the right of way.\"\\n60557694,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"According to the driver\\'s statement, he was trying to avoid a car turning left (going north) and veered sharply right, into the bike lane.

I got a light bump from behind from a White Lexus CT 200h, MD plates 6FZS01. Her bumper hit my back wheel. I was not hurt, and my bike was not damaged.

I hit the door mostly with my shoulder and sort of bounced off it and landed on the ground with my bike on top of me. Several people rushed to help me off the road. Luckily I wasn\\'t going fast...and kind of felt the door take most of the impact. I didn\\'t flip off...but rammed my right shoulder into my handlebars and then kind of rolls off my bike and just laid there. No head injury, but my adrenaline and my emotions were so high that I wasn\\'t in the best position to make any decisions. The driver didn\\'t even come to check on me, but 4 other people ran up, stopped and checked on me, picked me up and my bike. Carried me to sidewalk and kept asking me if I wanted to call 911. At first I thought they were all together with the driver so I figured after i was able to calm down I would get their info. When I stopped shaking I just started bawling. The people who stopped just sat with me and kept asking me what I needed and if i wanted to call 911. I said no but kept crying. The driver just stood next to his car looking scared. I even asked him if he was ok and about his car and he gave me a thumbs up and said he was even parked illegally, then got in his car and left. When I realized the other people weren\\'t with him...then I got super pissed but was too shocked to react. I could tell nothing was broken...the door and my handlebars took most of the impact. Didn\\'t call 911...but after I calmed down enough I walked to CVS and got an ice bag...took some ibuprofen and cried while I asked the CVS employee for help (so embarrassing), cried in front I the homeless dudes outside wholefoods, then eventually walked back towards DuPont and just waited for the bus. Went to the ER the next morning to get checked out and was given ibuprofen and ice. I was advised to contact the police afterwards to file a report even though i had no information, but when I did, the officers at the police station (Tenleytown, which was closest to my home) criticized me for not bringing any information and basically told me that i was wasting their time.\"\\n60734071,6810,Mount Rainier,MD,20712,Crash Description,Cyclist was heading east on Otis.

I was in the left most lane of 3 lanes in Georgetown and I felt myself pushed and lose control of my bike. I was going 10-15mph, she was going 25-30mph. I looked to my left and see a car touching me and eventually my wheel turned and I fell to my right. I was in disbelief. An African-American woman came out of the car screaming at me. I took a photo and can send it of her and the car. She claimed I drove into her lane and she didnt see me. I thought I was in the lane already and had the right of way. I was going to call the police but an African-American woman came 3-5 min later and said she is an attorney and a witness, and said I came into her lane. I was hoping another witness would come by but no one did, though there were many people around. I decided it wasnt worth it to purse since she had a witness and I did not, but wanted to ask WABA if they recommended I file a police report, or what. I went to the doctor and got xrays this morning but think nothigng is broken.\"\\n60778612,6810,Alexandria,VA,22314,Crash Description,\"Detailed, but brief...OK!! oxymoron. I was commuting home to Alex from Arlington. I had my headlight on. The lights of oncoming traffic on Four Mile Road may have contributed to the crash. A woman was walking the same direction I was riding. She was wearing dark clothing with a hoodie pulled up with no lights or reflectors. I ran into her and flipped over the handlebars, breaking my left collarbone, a rib and my bike. She eventually walked away. I never spoke to her. I took an Uber home and went to the ER. I\\'m just out of surgery so my typing leaves something to be desired with one arm.\"\\n60782898,6810,WASHINGTON,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I turned onto 16th southbound from Alaska avenue and shortly after near Aspen Road lost control and crashed after hitting several uneven bumps/patches in the road. I was probably going between 10 and 15 mph. This area of 16th is very dangerous for bikers heading southbound. It was even more so for me, as it was night so I was unable to gauge dangerous obstacles before hitting them. I think there may be more accidents to come if this road is not repaired.\"\\n60808581,6810,Arlington,VA,22203,Crash Description,\"I had descended off the Roosevelt bridge and I was following two Bikeshare riders at about 10mph. When we reached the wooden boardwalk section where the trail splits before the Roosevelt Island parking lot, the Bikeshare riders suddenly stopped without signaling because they were confused about the direction to go. I tapped my brakes and my bike slipped and slid on the bridge and I fell on my left side. A rider following me braked and also fell over and slid into me. The surface of the wooden boardwalk was very slippery. The other rider who fell got up and rode away. Other cyclists stopped and asked if I was OK. I got up and checked myself then walked my bike to the parking lot to adjust my back wheel, then I rode home. On Tuesday I went to an orthopedist who took an x-ray and told me I had Broken my leg.\"\\n60819857,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was biking on 18th Street, to the right of a line of moving cars, and to the left of a row of parked cars. Suddenly the car to my left swerved to park behind a row of cars on the right, hitting my bicycle in the process.

I skinned my knees and one of my palms, my knees and palms began bleeding. The driver stopped the car. The passenger got out to talk to me. The wheel of the driver\\'s car was on of my bicycle. The passenger told the driver he needed to back up so I could remove my bike. Bystanders asked how I was and helped wheel my bike to lean it against something. The driver apologized for hitting me. I said I didn\\'t know what to do, as I\\'ve never been hit by a car. The driver said he didn\\'t know either. I took a photo of his driver\\'s license and he wrote down his phone number. I called the District police the next day, and an officer came to my workplace to get my statement.\"\\n60838229,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,I was stopped at the red light at 14th while traveling east on U St when an older white SUV pushed into my leg .

He did not lift his head to check and see if there were cyclists on the road. There is already enough space there to include a 3-ft bike lane (which is why cyclists use this route around traffic in the mornings) and I think adding a green lane will help pedestrians to realize that there is fairly-constant bike traffic on that street in between traffic and the parked cars and will encourage them to look before blindly stepping into the street.\\n61092314,6810,Washington,DC,20024,Crash Description,I was rear-ended while both I and the vehicle were moving straight down Georgia Avenue.\\n61093099,6810,Manassas,VA,20110,Crash Description,\"At 15th and K street, cars turning right are supposed to yield to pedestrians and bicycles. This morning, a taxi was blocking both bike lanes. As I approached the blocking taxi from the south, another car cut around the taxi to turn right, creating another block. I then had to swerve to move between the car and the taxi in order to get myself out of the intersection. The car and taxi blocked the bike lanes completely, eliminating visibility for the cyclists. Another bicycle, also swerving to avoid the cars as she biked from the north end of the intersection, came around the taxi at the same moment I did, and we collided. Both the car and the taxi drove off without stopping to help. The other cyclist fell from her bike. We were both very shaken and we felt that the taxi and car blocking the intersection were ultimately responsible for our crash.\"\\n61100581,6810,Arlington,VA,22205,Crash Description,\"I was about 5-10 feet from the parked vehicle when the passenger opened up the rear passenger side door, essentially blocking the entire bike lane. The vehicle had not parked in a legal spot and was in the white stripe area which is meant to protect cyclists from this type of accident. Given the distance I was from the vehicle, I had no time to stop and hit the door, flying off of my bike. A nearby pedestrian saw the accident occur.\"\\n61113255,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was going westbound on Pennsylvania Avenue, and had a green light to go through the intersection. Right when I reached the intersection the taxi (which was stuck in stopped traffic to my right) made a left turn in front of me and hit me. I don\\'t recall seeing a turn signal. My front wheel was wedged between his front left tire and bumper, and was bent. I only hit the ground to steady myself with my hand. My bike didn\\'t go totally flat because of the way it was wedged into the car. A bus driver told police I ran the light, and I was issued a ticket. I never run lights on Pennsylvania Avenue and have a card of another witness the police officer couldn\\'t get on the phone, so I will be getting a statement from him and fighting the ticket.\"\\n61169441,6810,Rockville,MD,20850,Crash Description,\"This is an embarrassing one for what should be an experienced rider. Three things contributed to the fall: - Wet, very slick paint on the wooden bridge deck. - Very poor signage in small print giving directions for Alexandria vs. Roosevelt Island at the far end of the turn. For a new person to the area, the turn is also counter intuitive (left for Alexandria, straight for Roosevelt Island). - Experienced rider, not seeing the danger in the surface and concentrating on trying to see the sign and figure out where to go. My speed was between 4-8mph and slowing when my front tire lost traction and I fell. I understand that the Park service may have some sensitivity to an anti-skid treatment on the wooden deck above a wetland. There is no excuse for the signage being in small print past the intersection.\"\\n61176715,6810,Washington,DC,20024,Crash Description,I was traveling west on H Street NE between 5th and 6th Streets. I attempted to move from the far right lane to the center lane so that I could turn left onto 6th Street.

The victim was badly beaten and had a tooth knocked out. I called 911 and police and an ambulance responded. I am reporting this because I understand there have been other safety incidents on the Metropolitan Branch Trail. I wrote to Chief Cathy Lanier urging MPD to put cameras on the trail, and I would urge WABA to advocate for cameras as well.\"\\n61178781,6810,Alexandria,VA,22314,Crash Description,Crushed glass is being spread on the Mt. Vernon Trail from the Airport to Gravelly point. Most of the glass is carefully spread in the most vulnerable areas -- on the overpasses and the approaches and the crossing over the vehicle entrance on the trail to the Gravelly Point Parking Lot. Many bicyclists can be seen changing tires after passing through this area. The glass is consistently crushed into small pieces ideal for puncturing tires. This poses a clear danger to riders and other trail users and is also vandalism. This is a well-known hazard and we are surprised there has been little discussion of this issue or Park Police efforts to catch and prosecute the culprit.\\n61179571,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,vehicle stopped in the middle of the intersection adjacent to bike lane.

The driver of a parked gray SUV (a Jeep, I think) opened his door without looking and I hit the inside side of the door and was knocked off my bike into the street. Several bystanders, as well as the driver, rushed to see if I was okay. They helped me out of the street and grabbed me a chair from the nearby Exchange Saloon\\'s patio, as well as a bag of ice. The driver gave me his card and offered a ride to the ER at GW Hospital. I spent the evening in the ER and confirmed that I broke my right hand pretty badly. In my rush to the ER I didn\\'t think to call police or get the driver\\'s car insurance info, but I do have his contact info.\"\\n61233053,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was riding northbound on the 15th Street cycletrack. There was a small garden hose lying across the two-way bike lane, and another rider traveling southbound hit the hose and crashed directly in front of me. I had no time to stop, and ended up crashing into the other rider and getting flung over the bars. I impacted hard on my chest, knocked the wind out of myself, but was otherwise okay. Other rider was not wearing a helmet and sustained a small cut that bled heavily. I rendered aid to the other rider by giving him gauze out of my first aid kit, and exchanged contact information with him and another witness. We both declined EMS treatment or police involvement. I do not ascribe fault to the other cyclist- this was simply an accident. The other rider called me on April 15 to inquire as to my welfare. It turned out that he sustained a concussion, which was revealed after he sought medical treatment later on April 13. I continue to experience significant soreness on the left side of my chest, but I have no other injuries.\"\\n61236868,6810,washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"The crash occurred on Columbia Road, between 14th and 15th streets NW right after the H bus and Circulator pickup. The street is technically a two-lane one-way, but parked cars on both sides of the street mean it\\'s effectively a one-lane street. I was biking alongside traffic on the right side of street, between moving vehicles on my left and parked vehicles on my right. Right before Columbia Road crosses 15th street it bends approximately 30-45 degrees to the left before straightening out to cross 15th and 16th streets NW. I was biking alongside the Circulator bus at this time, maintaining my distance as best as I could, when we entered the turn. Rather than immediately beginning the gentle left turn, the bus maintained a straight trajectory (presumably to provide itself adequate room to make the left turn without hitting any parked cars on the left side of the road, since buses make wide turns). While the road continued to bend left and the bus kept straight, I was pushed closer and closer to the parked cars on the right side of the road. Unfortunately, I had little time to react (e.g., hit the bus to indicate that I was in danger) and the back of the bus made contact with my left bike handle and then my left bike pedal, pushing me into the parked car on the right and flipping the bike over. We were not traveling very fast, so though I fell off my bike I did not sustain any major injuries beyond scrapes and bruises on my extremities. Since I was pushed by the back of the bus, the driver did not see me and continued on through the stoplight at Columbia and 15th St. NW as the light turned yellow and then red. I caught the bus number but was unable to get the driver\\'s attention and I do not believe that he/she is aware of the incident.

I didn\\'t find out about the bent chainring until I tried to ride home a few minutes after the crash.\"\\n61256947,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"This was not a crash. However, the subject vehicle was parked in the bicycle lane eastbound on E Street right before N. Capitol Street. There was a lot of traffic on E Street so I tapped on driver\\'s window and asked her not to park in the bike lane. She opened the door and said, \"\"Go fuck yourself.\"\" I responded that it was illegal to stand, stop, or park in the bicycle lane and it was dangerous for me to swerve out into traffic. I continued on and a man (apparently her passenger) approached me as I was stopped at the light a N. Capitol, and said, \"\"Next time you do that, you are going to get hurt.\"\" As I cycled on toward Union Station, the driver of the blue sedan honked at me and tried to run me over. I nearly fell as she continued to rev the engine and lay on the horn.

Slowly, the driver started to creep up on me, and appeared to intentionally move towards the right side of the lane, where I was. I tried my best to move my bike further to the right as he came closer and closer. With very limited space to move to, I eventually lost my balance and fell - directly in front of the Honda. Fortunately, he stopped rather than run me over, and I got up and pulled my bike out of the way (by going onto Old Georgetown Rd) as fast as I could.

I swerved to the right of the car to remain in the remaining portion of the bike lane when the passanger swung their door open, hitting me on my bike, sending me into the parked van on the other side of the bike lane, and causing me to fall and getting two pretty nasty cuts on my leg - one deep enough to require medical attention because while crashing my chain ring teeth actually went into my calf. The passenger helped me up and the taxi drive continued eating his sandwich in his car. When I said, \"\"please do not use the bike lane as a parking spot. Drop your passengers off in a safe location\"\" he responded \"\"I have to drop by passenger off, I have to drop my passenger off\"\" and wouldn\\'t say anything else. I got back on my bike and grabbed a first aid kit when I got to work, but am so upset about it. Luckily I was paying attention was able to swerve and was not biking quickly, but it could have ended much worse.\"\\n61317653,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"Cyclist traveling south on 16th.

I observed no break in flow southbound and gave the vehicle a wide Berth as I proceeded north in the cross walk with the walking signal. She did not look right and ran into me as I was centered on her car. My bike broke her license plate holder and damaged my bicycle. Pending local bike shop visit. I took a picture of her license plate and my bike on the ground in the cross walk. She yelled at me, blamed me for the accident and then drove off.\"\\n61321315,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was biking eastbound on I St NW. I approached 6th St NW and stopped at the red light. When the light turned green, cars traveling southbound on 6th St NW had blocked the intersection and were stuck there when their light turned red and my light turned green. I attempted to pass in front of the cars blocking the intersection. Halfway through the intersection, a taxi cab attempted to continue through the intersection once it had cleared enough, didn\\'t see me, and hit me while I was in the intersection. A pedestrian helped me up, I took a quick picture of the cab\\'s license plate, and then we both stopped on the southeast corner of 6th and I St NW. I was not seriously injured. After a few minutes of him apologizing and me explaining that it is illegal to \"\"block the box\"\", we proceeded to go on our separate ways. A few seconds later a police car pulled the cab driver over and I stopped as well. The police officers said they had seen the crash happen, and presumably were waiting for the cab driver to drive away (to see if he would call the police on his own, which he didn\\'t). The police told the cab driver that regardless of the circumstances, even if the person is not hurt, it is the law that he must call the police after a crash. The police officers took my statement and I left. I do not know what happened to the cab driver (i.e., if he was issued a citation or not). Other than a few bruises, I was not injured and the Capital Bikeshare bike I was riding was not damaged.\"\\n61321608,6810,Arlington,VA,22204,Crash Description,I was in Roslyn on N.

She turned right without warning and without seeing me and knocked me off the bike (I was travelling in the painted bike lane heading straight on N. Lynn St.).\\n61321834,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"Metropolitan Police Department CCN# 013-969 Statement from Amanda Munroe (Cyclist Involved) regarding the vehicle/bicycle crash on Tuesday, January 24 at approximately 8:50am at Volta Place and 34th Street NW, Washington DC. I (Amanda) was riding my bicycle to work the morning of Tuesday, January 24th. I have cycled this route most weekday mornings since I began my job at Georgetown University in October, 2013. I was wearing a black coat, sunglasses, and a helmet. I was riding West on Volta Pl. NW shortly before 9:00 in the morning, (I do know I arrived to my office at 37th and P streets NW after the accident at almost exactly 9:00am) and riding uphill. Volta Park was on my right. The climb of the hill usually requires a lot of exertion before cresting at the top because it is steep, so I was going slowly. I arrived at the stop sign at the top of the hill at the 34th Street NW. There I saw that there was a black sedan at the intersection traveling South down 34th Street NW, which is a one-way street. I saw the vehicle come to a complete stop at the stop sign. The car stayed at a stop, which I believed was an indication for me to proceed. I travel this route every workday and cars at this intersection specifically and at many intersections often stop long to indicate to bikers that they should cross the street because they have seen them. I assumed this car had stopped long as an indication for me to proceed. I proceeded into the intersection and to the left so as to take a wide arc far from the front of the car. Then I noticed in my periphery that the car was heading in my direction and I remember realizing that it must not see me. I yelled “hey!” loudly and remember pressing my brakes. I remember realizing that the car was going to hit me before I would be able to physically swerve away from the car, and then it did. The left nose of the car hit me on the right back side of my body as if we were at the top of an inverted V. It came to an immediate stop. I fell off my bike and the left side of my body hit the ground. I wasn’t propelled, it was more like I fell over and my bike went out behind me. I looked up and saw that the car was stopped. I felt that my knees and left elbow were stinging. The driver got out of the car and asked if I was alright. I said “give me a minute” and got up slowly and moved out of the road. There was a pedestrian at the intersection. I am not sure how my bike got out of the road – I think the young man who was at the intersection moved it. I moved around the front of the driver’s car to get out of the road and sat down on the sidewalk ramp to the crosswalk (diagonally across from Volta Park), and I was sitting down and looking directly at the rear right-hand door of her 4-door car. The driver asked repeatedly if I was sure I was alright. I didn’t really know but I was trying to stay calm. I felt that my left knee was stinging so we both rolled up the leg of my leggings and saw I had skinned my knee. I was still realizing that she hadn’t seen me at all, so I asked her to confirm that she hadn’t seen me because I thought at the intersection that she clearly had seen me, which is why she had stayed stopped at the sign. I asked the young man who stayed at the site if he had seen it and he replied, “I heard it.” The driver asked me if she should call anybody, if she should call an ambulance. I said “No, I don’t think I need you to call anyone.” I said, “I would like your information, if that’s alright.” She agreed and asked me if I could find her a pen, I could not find one in my bag. The young man had a pen and gave it to her. She wrote down her first and last name and her cell phone number and said “I’m sorry we had to meet this way.” I said “Me too.” I asked the young man to walk me to my office and asked for his contact information. He walked my bike and me to my office. He wrote down the license plate number and make of the car and his name and phone number. The next day I decided to call to report the incident. I first called the MPD Public Information Office to ask if it was too late to report a traffic incident. They said it was not too late, if I was in DC, and recommended that I call 911. I called 911 and explained the incident and 911 informed me that I should make a report of the incident to a police officer. The police officer Eduardo Ashby, badge #2756 parked on my street, gestured for me to come outside my house, and asked me why I was reporting it now, a day after the incident. I explained that I was injured and I needed to have a record of the incident. He did not ask me for very much information other than the license plate number and make of the car and the location and time of day it happened. I was not able to make a full statement to the police, I only answered questions that the officer asked me. He also frequently interrupted my explanations and waved off my answers saying the information I was sharing was not something he needed to know. After this interaction, I shared the report number with the driver of the vehicle via text message.\"\\n61325364,6810,Washington,DC,20007,Crash Description,\"I was heading west on O st, straight through the New Jersey intersection. Driver took left turn while coming east on O st, failed to yield (or even signal) and accelerated through intersection as they clipped my front tire. I kicked off their front right wheel well and they fled the scene. One witness said she only looked up because she heard the driver\\'s tires peel out as the accelerated away from the scene.\"\\n61332438,6810,Alexandria,VA,22302,Crash Description,I was stopped at a red traffic light behind a car that was also stopped at the red light. A truck hit me from behind. My bike was damaged (I later went to the truck driver\\'s residence and he paid me for a new bike)\\n61343892,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"Harassment (not crash). There were a lot of cars on the road in the neighborhood, so I chose to take the lane to ensure I was visible and at a safe distance. The driver behind me insisted on speeding up around me (on L St NE between 8th to 9th St NE). As she passed I saw her holding and talking on her cell phone. I yelled \"\"get off your phone!\"\". She stopped the car as she was passing a double parked pick-up truck, so both lanes were blocked and I was stuck until she moved. She proceeded to yell profanities and threats at me - about how I\\'m a white bitch and I better fucking watch out because she\\'ll run over my fucking ass, etc. Then she sped up again in front of me. As we stopped at a stop sign (corner of L St and West Virginia NE) she continued to yell profanities and threats to my safety. I had to do a Copenhagen left onto West Virginia Ave NE because the driver and the van driver behind us would not let me into turn left. Feeling shook up with adrenaline, I took the lane going north on West Virginia Ave NE until I got home to Penn St NE.\"\\n61343978,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"This was an assault/verbal altercation with a few cars illegally turning around in the bike lanes to avoid the horrible traffic. I tried to nicely alert a driver that she shouldn\\'t turn around in the bike lanes to avoid the worse than normal gridlocked traffic (thanks to SafeTrack). She happened to see another individual do the same thing right before her (that guy got screamed at by a bunch of awesome cyclists) and I wanted to nicely discourage her from doing the same. Instead of taking my warning to heart, she told me (in not a nice way) to mind my own business and started throwing out some vulgar names. Suffice to say I didn\\'t take kindly to that and told her she was doing something illegal and she could seriously injure cyclists who have every right to be in our bike lanes. As more and more people continue to drive instead of take the Metro, I\\'m afraid motorists will increasingly use the Pennsylvania Ave bike lanes as a turn around point. It would be great if we could add additional deterrents or police presence on those lanes. I commute daily on those lanes and would be more than happy to help ensure that cyclist safety is ensured during SafeTrack.\"\\n61346598,6810,Washington,DC,20012,Crash Description,\"Driver pulled out of a parking lot, as I was riding up the bike lane. She crossed into the bike lane where I was traveling and struck the rear right chain stays, rack, rear wheel and damaged my fender and lighting system. She was able to stop before she crushed my bike, I was able to react and not get knocked off. I took photos of her car where the liscense plate frame was twisted from impacting my bike, the plate slightly bent and the front bumper marked up. She has since made repairs to her vehicle and claimed to her insurance company that I ran into her.\"\\n61347114,6810,WASHINGTON,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"Bike lane shifts into a shared road, cars were not respecting distance so a few bikers shifted to the sidewalk, as I passed the crosswalk a car took a right turn and struck my bike\"\\n61378599,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was in the bike lane on Vermont Ave. NW with the green light to go onto 14th Street. The truck turned right onto 14th Street, without using a turning signal, causing me to swerve to avoid being hit. I took a photo of the truck\\'s license plate, and the driver told me to meet him up at the next intersection when he pulls over. After getting out of the truck he got in my face and threatened to put my \"\"dick-sucking pussy ass in the ER.\"\" He told me to walk away and leave his job site (I was on the sidewalk, where he had requested we meet) unless I wanted him to \"\"slam\"\" me. This occurred at the construction site on the northwest corner of 14th Street and Rhode Island Avenue. There were construction employees who witnessed the entire encounter. For my own safety, I biked away and then called the company name that was on the side of the truck: Johnson Crane Service Inc., located in Beltsville, Md. I described the above encounter to the woman who answered the phone and when I gave her the name of the driver (Mike), she said she would have the owner call me back when he gets in. I\\'ve yet to hear from anyone. The license plate number is MD 9BG 2646. The truck also had a yellow license plate with the DC flag on it. That plate number is 1286 65.\"\\n61382581,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,Driver took a right turn into the bike lane at a green light and hit me from the side.\\n61383794,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,I was riding south on 18th St. NW and the white SUV was in front of me parked.

The car was moving northbound and made a left turn across my path through traffic. I saw the front of his car, yelled, and that\\'s all I remember until waking up on the ground. This happened a few weeks ago and his insurance contacted me right away, but then silence. I\\'m not sure how I go about getting compensation for my medical bills, bike repair/replacement, etc.\"\\n61406288,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"Myself and girlfriend were biking westbound on R St. While entering intersection of R & 13 St NW via the bike lane, a silver dodge magnum recklessly (w/out blinker) cut right into the bike lane while we were nearly passing the vehicle. This forced me to dodge left behind the vehicle and my girlfriend to smash into me (rather than smash into the rear of the car). Driver saw the pile up he caused in the intersection, cursed at me after I yelled at him, and fled the scene. Police officer said that b/c the car never struck us, this was not considered a Traffic Accident and therefore not a hit and run. Is this True? Are cars not liable unless they strike a bike? Are cars not accountable after causing an accident between cyclists? Luckily only minimal damage was done to bikes and persons (injuries listed below). The license plate(DY393A) a witness recorded showed showed no results when the police searched their database, so we could not file a \"\"damage of property\"\". This accident could have been drastically more sever had we hit the car instead of swerving into traffic + each other.\"\\n61412922,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"Maroon Range Rover tried to speed up to quickly turn into the garage at 601 E St. NW and swerved across the bike lane rather than waiting 5 seconds for me to clear the garage. Clipped me, my handlebars scratched their car and they drove into the garage--didn\\'t stop.\"\\n61421729,6810,Annapolis,MD,21409,Crash Description,\"My wife and I were waiting for the light to change from red to green, back one car from the P St light. We were going on to Vermont Ave and turning right at that next opportunity, so we were in the second lane from the right, with the furthest right lane taken by cars waiting for the green arrow for P St. As is happening more often, several vehicles were in Logan Circle to the left of our car, with the objective of \"\"cutting in\"\" when the light changed to join our progress onto Vermont Ave. I was driving, and to my left was the Black car involved in the accident with the bike, and in front of that Black car was a white vehicle (I think it was a small pickup truck). When the light changed, the white vehicle tried to enter the flow of traffic onto Vermont Ave but it was very slow going. The Black car went left of the white vehicle and then darted to the right, possibly in an effort to get on P St as it didn\\'t look to me driving that the cut in was for Vermont Ave. As our car was stopped, out of my right vision I saw the bicyclist go by our car. I mentioned to my wife, in the front passenger seat, something like \"\"I can\\'t believe the bike got past that car cutting in.\"\" My wife said she thought she heard a collision of the bike and car. There was a young woman pedestrian with ear-buds in waiting to cross into Logan Circle or over to Vermont Ave who was looking at where the collision would have occurred. Cars began to move forward, we passed the fallen bike rider and my wife observed that he was holding his head. As I saw it briefly, there were 2 or 3 people standing or kneeling over the fallen bike rider.\"\\n61422293,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I was traveling east in the bike lane on L Street NW between 19th and 18th Streets when an SUV came up behind me where I couldn\\'t see her and turned into the parking garage, crossing over my bike lane and cutting me off. The driver, a woman in her mid-fifties, froze in my path and my bike collided with her drivers\\' side door falling to the ground with my bike tumbling on top of me. I landed on my left side and my right arm partially braced my fall.\"\\n61436078,6810,WASHINGTON,DC,20019,Crash Description,\"I was riding northbound on 3rd St NW approching my office at 3rd and C st NW. There was a car stopped in the middle of the road (in the crosswalk). As I rode past the car, to the right of it, the passenger opened her door into me. This caused my to fall off my bike. I sustained injuries to my left leg and foot. I was wearing a helmet and riding gloves. The driver of the car was ticketed for \"\"No Parking Anytime.\"\"\"\\n61436098,6810,Silver Spring,MD,20910,Crash Description,\"The path is unridable, and I was yelled at for biking on the road.\"\\n61477822,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was riding down the street (on the CVS side of Columbia Road) in the bike lane, it was pretty busy car traffic-wise. A red car coming from the opposite direction turned left extremely quickly in front of me, leaving me no time to stop. I slammed straight into her back door and bounced off--landed on the ground. Headset is out of alignment and not sure what else is damaged on the bike. A little bruised on the hand and have some back and neck pain. Didn\\'t hit my head on the ground though, thankfully.\"\\n61480448,6810,washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,TRST\\n61542886,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"I was riding on the right side of 17th street toward K street and all of a sudden, from my right side, a door hit me that was opening at the moment I was passing the parked car. I was looking straight ahead as I rode, so I would have seen the door had it already been open. I flew over my handlebar when the door hit me and fell onto the street. The driver got out of the car and just looked at me. Then I crawled to the sidewalk and lied there as I was feeling lightheaded. Shortly after, a police officer who was passing and noticed me on the sidewalk stopped at the scene (the officer was not called). The officer asked if I was okay and if I required an ambulance. I told her no. She then asked me what happened - I responded with the above. Then she asked the driver if he looked before he opened his door, to which he responded, \"\"Yes, I didn\\'t see anything.\"\" Then she accused me of looking down (although she wasn\\'t on the scene when it occurred) and said I should not have not been riding that close to the parked cars. She then said she had to issue me a ticket because my action was illegal. She took my information and the driver\\'s. Then I tried to explain more clearly what had happened - emphasizing that I was looking ahead as I rode and I should not be receiving a ticket. The officer called another police officer onto the scene who also claimed my action was illegal. By then my boyfriend had arrived and we both continued to question the officers about why I was at fault. Again they said it was illegal to ride so close to parked cars. I was baffled by this, but wanting to tend to my injuries I just took the ticket and the officer\\'s business card then left the scene. Later I discovered my bike was damaged by the accident. I had the damage assessed and repair for the bike will cost $285.53 (specifically my crank was damaged along with bottom bracket - both need to be replaced). The specific infraction on my ticket is \"\"Failing to give to operation of vehicle\"\" (Code: T013 [DCMR 18 § 2213.4]). I looked this up in the D.C. Municipal Regulations and D.C. Register (http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Gateway/RuleHome.aspx?RuleNumber=18-2213) 2213.4 states, \"\"An operator shall, when operating a vehicle, give full time and attention to the operation of the vehicle.\"\" The officers told me that I got the ticket for riding too closely to parked cars. But clearly, given my actual citation, I was given a ticket for not paying attention - something that I was indeed doing. There\\'s no way to see that a car door will open while you are passing it.\"\\n61546044,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was riding eastbound on Rhode Island Ave. NW and taking the left lane. An SUV travelling northbound on 5th Ave. NW failed to stop at the stop sign and t-boned me on my right side. This caused me to fall over with my bike on my left side, pinning my leg under the bike. The driver reversed so that I could get myself out from under the bike. I moved my bike to the sidewalk, sat on the curb and my partner dialed 911 for police assistance. The driver remained at the scene of the crash. The took my information and the information of the driver, wrote a police report, and issued the driver two citations, one for Failure to Yield to a Bicyclist and one for Driving Without Proof of Insurance. I did not suffer any injuries beyond bruising and abraisons on my left knee. I went to the hospital for an exam and x-ray to verify this. My bicycle was damaged in the accident. The right crank arm was sheered off, my gearing was bent, my handlebar tape was shredded, and my wheels do not spin. I plan to take my bike to a shop for an assessment of damages and estimate of repair costs.\"\\n62013103,6810,Washington,DC,20018,Crash Description,\"I was traveling eastbound downhill on Newton Street NE, the vehicle was parked facing eastbound on the side of the road and suddenly, without warning , signal, or looking pulled out making an illegal u-turn to travel west bound. I attempted to break but ended up crashing into the driver rear quarter panel and flipping over the car. I called 911 and reported the accident, the MPD took 40 minutes to arrive at the scene. When they finally arrived the police asked me if I stopped at the intersection(which was approximately 200 feet away from the crash), I was honest and said I did not come to a complete stop so they cited me for not stopping at the intersection and cited the driver for making an illegal u-turn. They said we were both at fault. In the report the police listed the location of the accident at the intersection which was incorrect, I sent the police the GPS from my phone showing the location of the accident but they did not include that in the report. They also listed the damage to my bicycle as \"\"minor scratches,\"\" though the fork was bent to the point where the wheel is almost touching the frame, and \"\"minor scratches,\"\" to the drivers car though there was a massive dent where I hit him. Ironically he had a bumper sticker that read: \"\"hows my driving: dial 1-800-eat-shit,\"\" which I think he peeled off before the officers arrived.\"\\n62031090,6810,Loveland,OH,45140,Crash Description,A metro bus came up from behind me and I was struck on my left hand by the lights that protrude from the side of the bus.\\n62087981,6810,Washington,DC,20017,Crash Description,\"I was riding on the sidewalk, traveling west on Michigan Ave. I was crossing the intersection in the crosswalk with a green light and walk man on. The van was traveling south on 4th towards the red light. I was in the center of the crosswalk and when the van ran into me at a 90 degree angle. I believe the driver was going to stop further up at the light to turn right on red, but she did not stop or even slow down considerably through the crosswalk, and there were no trees or bushes obscuring her view. I was toppled sideways and she stopped in time to not run me or my bike over. I stood up and wrote down her license plate number. The driver was apologetic and asked if I needed an ambulance. I was not bleeding and didn\\'t feel any significant pain, so I did not want to have to pay for an ambulance and said not to call one. I wrote down the drivers name and phone number. She left a few minutes later. I realized after she left that my bike was a little damaged and that my right should and upper back was numb from being struck by the van. After work, I went to the police station on Monroe and Georgia Ave, NW to make a report. The officer was not very helpful and reluctant to do anything.\"\\n62104889,6810,Arlington,VA,22213,Crash Description,\"I and two other cyclists were involved in a bicycle accident on the Custis Trail in Arlington. None of us exchanged contact information after the crash, so I will refer to them simply as cyclists #1 and #2. The accident resulted in property damage to my bike. According to a bike shop, my bike is no longer safe to ride, due to a cracked frame. The accident also resulted in injuries to me, but not to the other cyclists. I was riding eastbound on the trail, going down a hill at about 20-25 mph. Cyclists #1 and #2 were traveling in the opposite direction, at about the same speed, with #1 just ahead of #2. The three of us collided near the bottom of a downhill section. From my perspective, it appeared that #2 was traveling too close to #1, possibly causing their wheels to touch, which made the two crash. At that point, one or both bikes went into my lane. I was unable to avoid hitting their bikes, so I crashed too. I hit the pavement on my right shoulder, head (I was wearing a helmet), and right knee. I had a wound on my right knee with blood coming out, scrapes on my arms, and my right shoulder was in extreme pain. I felt on the verge of fainting or going into shock. I was not thinking straight and did not think to exchange contact info. None of us called 911. At some point, #2, hopped on his bike and rode away. #1 checked on my condition, asked if I needed a cell phone, and he helped me roll my broken bike up the hill to a point on the trail where I could be reached by a car (N. Vermont St.). When I told #1 that I could handle my bike for the rest of the distance, he hopped on his bike and rode off. I called my wife who picked me up and took me directly to Arlington Hospital. At the ER, I was given an IV and they bandaged my wounds. They took about 8 X-rays and a CT scan of my head. Due to my accident, I cannot lift my right arm without feeling severe pain in my right shoulder.\"\\n62120893,6810,Silver Spring,MD,20902,Crash Description,\"Girl of about 11 years old riding next to her mother, so girl in wrong lane (lane for oncoming traffic) riding straight toward me. I am talking about lanes of bike path. Girl did not slow down or move. I slowed down but since she wasn\\'t moving I had to swerve off path to avoid hitting her. If I had swerved to left I would have hit her mother, so I had to swerve right. At that point there is a drop off to the creek bed on the right, which has a retaining wall. I fell onto the retaining wall straight down from path, a few feet. The girl and her mother did not turn back just left the scene/kept going.

As I do every day during this stretch of my commute, I was splitting the lane between the right turn lane and the lane for the traffic to proceed straight (my intention was to go straight). About 50m from the intersection, a car door to my left opened as the passenger in the front seat of the car went to exit the vehicle. I caught the door in the crook of my arm and fell into the car that was to my right as it was stopped and waiting to make a right hand turn.\"\\n62161474,6810,Washington,DC,20006,Crash Description,\"I was riding down the street, and in front of me was a red-colored cab that appeared to be either going slow or not moving. I started to pass on the left, when the cab unexpectedly turned left -- I don\\'t remember it using a blinker -- and I did not have sufficient time to brake or evade before running into the cab. I was apparently uninjured, although I did feel scared and dazed. My bicycle only had the handlebars slightly out of alignment with the front tire. As for the cab, its left mirror was hanging off the door, and a black piece of plastic, which I presume came from the mirror, had fallen onto the street. The cab driver exited his vehicle and blamed me for the crash. I\\'m not sure to what extent he was actually correct, but at the time, I wasn\\'t thinking straight and wanted to escape from a nerve-wracking situation, and I don\\'t do well with personal confrontation even on my best day. So I accepted fault and told him I would pay for it. He took down my name and phone number, and he insisted I write a statement acknowledging responsibility and then sign my name; I wrote \"\"I was at fault.\"\" and then placed my signature underneath. (Again, whether this was a fair interpretation of the facts, I\\'m not sure.) The driver said at one point he would contact the police. During this exchange, a woman approached unbidden, told me she had seen everything, and then passed me her phone number, saying I should contact her if I needed anything. Her name was Amy, and her number was (202) 271-1688. Shortly thereafter, I left, not having the clarity of thought to collect the driver\\'s information or that of the passengers in his car. Aside from the misaligned handlebars, my bike worked well enough for me to ride it to the REI in Bailey\\'s Crossroads, where I had bought a week or so prior, thinking I might have it checked out in conjunction with the free tune-up they offer for new bikes. They told me they couldn\\'t do the tune-up until August 8, but they did inspect my bike for any damage and didn\\'t find anything aside from the aforementioned handlebar misalignment, which they fixed for free. I have yet to hear from the driver, and I don\\'t know whether he actually has contacted or will contact the police.\"\\n62175188,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"I was traveling southbound, commuting to work, and going at a decent clip. The car in front of me took a right hand turn out of the blue. I\\'m uncertain if he used a blinker, but regardless it was a very quick, sharp turn. I hit the brakes but still hit, fairly hard, the rear passenger side door of his car, and managed to fall in a manner that nothing was seriously hurt, other than a little road rash. I was really lucky. The car behind him stopped at the scene and got the driver of the car I crashed into to pull over.\"\\n62192944,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was going straight on Reservoir.

As he was getting out of the car, I attempted to maneuver around his car and get away. Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t accelerate fast enough to avoid the individual as he rapidly approached my bike and shoved me to the ground while I was in motion. Although startled, I managed to get to my feet and call 911. While getting up and calling 911, the individual was yelling in my face that I hit his car. He appeared to be upset because about a block west of our location (1600 Block of Euclid), he was parked in the bike lane and the street was crowded with cars. When I maneuvered around his car, I had to move extremely slowly to avoid traffic and almost lost my balance. I put my hand on his car several times for leverage and I that appeared to be the spark sent him over the edge. The police responded but I decided not press charges. They were helpful and professional, but one of the officers seemed to rationalize that individual\\'s actions were understandable because that individual thought I hit his car and was fleeing the scene. From my perspective, I can understand why the motor felt angry (he told the police he has had numerous incidents with cyclists) but that isn\\'t an acceptable excuse for chasing me down in his car, blocking my egress, getting out of his car, charing me and shoving me off my bike while in motion In the motorist account to the police, he claimed that I lunged at him which simply isn\\'t true - especially considering that I was on a bike trying to pedal away from him. Moreover, I am back pain sufferer and had major surgery 10 years ago. To avoid aggravating my back issues, I always avoid situations that unnecessarily put me in harms ways such as physical confrontations. To close, there were no witnesses to corroborate my side of the story and rather than perpetuate a he said she said battle with this motorist that would have gone nowhere in court, I asked the police if I can have a word with him. The police obliged, we both apologized (even though I had no real reason to apologize) and went off on our way...\"\\n62565783,6810,Washington,DC,20024,Crash Description,\"Riding in 4th street bike lane (after having gone around two other cars parked in that bike lane), began to pass this car as it slowed to a stop in the vehicle lane of traffic.

They could have used the parkway itself or just the south bound lane of the trail. Who were they? What permit did they have? Who granted the permission for their exclusive pleasure? The only police force I know that looks and behaves like this is the Secret Service.\"\\n62639251,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was biking along a quiet street, across an intersection where I had a green light. From the other side of the intersection a police car was coming. It suddenly decided to take a left turn, across the lane where I was biking and cut off my path. I only managed to get one hand on a brake and braked as hard as I could but still hit the car with some momentum in the side. It was enough to lift me off the saddle and mess up my front wheel, but luckily nothing more dramatic then that. In the end, what left me more shocked wasn’t the impact itself, it was the behavior of the police officer that followed. She waited in her car for several minutes while I inspected the damage on my bike before she finally exited the car and talked to me. The first thing she asked was “So what do YOU think happened?” in a tone that seemed to imply that she had a different opinion anyways. I told her that I was biking across an intersection where I had a green light. She insisted that she “also had the right of way” since I was still “far away” from the intersection when she turned. It’s hard to tell in retrospective, but it seemed that I had about 3 seconds from when I saw her turn to the moment of impact. Interestingly, there was a woman standing nearby who saw it happen. When she saw the police officer talking to me she came over and offered to stay around since she witnessed the event. The police officer told her that would not be necessary and that she could leave. That seemed strange to me and I asked the woman if I could get her number before she left in case it became necessary. The police officer had called her sergeant in the meantime but then told me that, actually, I could just leave too, it would take her sergeant “at least 15 more minutes” to arrive at the scene. I replied that I would like to talk to her sergeant and wait. The sergeant finally arrived and asked me to tell him what had happened. After I finished, he said that the damage on my bike didn’t look that bad and that he remembered having fixed something like that a while back. Also, if my brakes were working adequately, which they did. He then walked around to the other side of the car with the officer, turning their backs on me so that I couldn’t hear what they where talking about. After a couple more minutes the woman who had witnessed the event came back with her dog and asked me if I was ok. We started talking about what happened for a bit and it seemed that only then did the sergeant remember that I was still around and came over to hand me complaint form that I could fill out. They weren’t really interested in whether the form was filled out correctly. The sergeant then basically told me that it wouldn’t make sense to pursue this incident any further since nothing would come of it. I asked if I could at least get a refund in case I had to bring my bike to the bike store, to which he said “I’ve never seen them do that”. Throughout the whole interaction both the officer and the sergeant didn’t ask me once whether I was ok. All they seemed to care about was for me to just drop the incident and leave. They were undiscerning, unfriendly, unhelpful and even slightly threatening. Before I left, I told the officer the she should really pay more attention when turning, which I had to repeat to make her hear it since at the point she was playing with her phone and smoking her second or third cigarette.\"\\n62659414,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"I was traveling west on S St NW when the car ran a red light going south on New Jersey Ave NW and struck me and my bike on my right side, knocking me onto the street\"\\n62685604,6810,Fairfax,VA,22031,Crash Description,\"I was cycling east along the W&OD trail by Four Mile Run Drive and crossing Walter Reed Drive on the pedestrian crossing when a black Suburban SUV crossed in front of me having turned right into Walter Reed Drive from Four Mile Run Drive.

A car traveling east-bound on N Street turned into James Apartments (1425 N St. NW) at the same time that I was passing by the entrance of the apartment complex in the bike lane, resulting in the crash. I was unable to react before hitting the grill of the car, then the windshield. I went over the top of the car, landing on the ground on the other side. My knee had a serious laceration, and I had a mild \"\"rug burn\"\" type injury on my shoulder where I either hit part of the car or ground. I cannot say for sure. I was otherwise uninjured. My head hit the windshield, but I was wearing a helmet. I went through concussion protocol, and it was determined that I had not been concussed. I had no earbuds in, nor was I on the phone while riding my bike at any time. The driver of the car called the police/ambulance after checking to make sure that I was in a stable condition. There was also a woman named Elizabeth who worked in one of the buildings nearby who heard the crash and came outside to see what had happened. When the ambulance arrived, the paramedics placed a splint on my leg and a brace on my neck. They collected my bag, helmet and bike; locked my bike and took me to the hospital. I talked to the police briefly before being taken away, and I am unsure of what occurred after I left.\"\\n63243661,6810,Arlington,VA,22201,Crash Description,\\n63248127,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was riding south on Mass Ave NW approaching the Naval Observatory and as I passed Edmunds St NW a Secret Service police officer pulled out of Observatory Circle NW in front of me to block traffic for a motorcade. I couldn\\'t really see his vehicle as there is a tree with large branches obstructing the view on that particular corner, and the officer also pulled out from the left-hand side of the street (i.e. the opposite side of normal traffic flow), so he was even more hidden than he would have otherwise been. As I saw him pull out I attempted to brake to avoid his car, but I probably had less than 30 feet to do so and, moreover, I was riding at approximately 25 mph, which made it impossible. I instinctively pulled left thinking that if he saw me and stopped I could potentially go around the front of his vehicle, but he did not stop and I ended up crashing into his driver-side door. It seemed like the front end of my bike took the initial hit since my front rack & handlebars shifted significantly, but my right shoulder ended up taking most of the impact.\"\\n63253375,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was biking on 14th St NE on the right side of the road with the intent of going straight through the intersection.

Only when I had crossed the crosswalk did I see the vehicle turn (it still hadn\\'t turned on the right turn signal).

I got to the point where it crosses over Great Falls St in Falls Church, and there\\'s a stop sign and then a crosswalk. I stopped. On my left there was a car already stopped at the crosswalk since there was another cyclist crossing and already in the crosswalk, coming towards me. On my right there was a car coming, at a distance, very slow, and breaking/slowing down. I thought that it was safe to cross and I did that. When I was on the second half of the crosswalk I noticed that the car on my right that had been previously slowing down had suddenly accelerated and was coming at me at a speed (I think she was looking at the other cyclist and as soon as the other cyclist cleared she hit the gas without noticing me). Since I was coming out of a stop I wasn\\'t going that fast and I couldn\\'t just get out of the way, so she hit me on my right side and I flew up in the air and landed on my head 10-12 feet to the left of the crosswalk. I didn\\'t black out but almost. She got out of the car and said \"\"I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t see you, I was distracted looking at those dogs\"\". The girl driving the car already stopped at the left of the crosswalk got out of the car and called 911. A firetruck, an ambulance and three police cars arrived. I didn\\'t know I had a concussion so I told them that I didn\\'t need to go to the hospital. A police officer asked me what had happened and I told him, and then he proceeded and started talking to several witnesses and to the driver. After 30 min or so he came and gave me a citation for \"\"Failure to comply with a stop sign\"\" and said that I had been found at fault. I asked him why, since I had stopped, and he said that \"\"I should have waited until the intersection was clear\"\". I told them that it wasn\\'t an intersection, that it was a crosswalk, and he told me that I could explain the whole thing to the judge. The citation was for January 21st. I went to court and talked to the City Lawyer/Prosecutor and told her that I thought all this was a severe mistake since I was a bicycle traveling on a shared-use path and crossing a crosswalk and that per 46.2-904 I should have been considered a pedestrian and not a vehicle, and that it wasn\\'t even the intersection of two highways. She offered me a $25 guilty plea, which I didn\\'t take. I talked to the Judge when called and pleaded not guilty.

When the traffic cleared we both proceeded into the intersection. Because she was not signaling her intention to turn, and I thought we would both pass straight through. Instead, she turned left. I saw through the windshield that she was craning her neck all the way around behind her, and wasn\\'t looking where she was going. I didn\\'t have time to stop, so she plowed into my left leg, knocking me off my bike.\"\\n63641454,6810,Arlington,VA,22205,Crash Description,I was on W&OD Trail traveling east on the bike path towards Shirlington. I was at the intersection across from Barcroft sports complex where there is a service road that connects the two parrallel Four Mile Run drives. The light was green in the direction of travel on Four Mile Run. I was about 15-20 yards from the intersection with the walk signal as I approached the intersection it changed to flashing hand. I entered the intersection a White BMW traveling west on Four Mile Drive made the right onto the service road and cut me off. I impacted the hood of the BMW and rolled across the hood into the grass on the other side. I was traveling approximately 16 mph according to my Strava Data.\\n63645691,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,Traveling in bike lane on Pennsylvania when taxi took an illegal u-turn into my path.

I hit the front quarter panel , became separated from my bike and was sent over the hood to the ground on the other side.\"\\n63671889,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was going southbound on 14th St NW. A car going northbound decided to make an illegal U-turn in the middle of the street, without checking to see if any bikes were coming on the southbound side (there were no cars on either side). He turned quickly and didn\\'t see me, even after I waved my arms and shouted. I tried to stop and move as close to the curb as possible, but couldn\\'t stop in time. He swiped me on the side as he was finishing his U-turn. The full lane is available to bikes on that stretch of 14th St. One question: if I was not injured and my bike was fine, am I still supposed to call the police? Though uninjured, I was very much in shock and started crying and yelling before I rode away.\"\\n63673068,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"I was commuting to work on the M Street bike land (between 18th and 19th streets) and flipped over my bike due to a hose line that was spread across the bike lane from a service truck in the street to a hook up at the Chipotle restaurant at 1837 M Street NW. I flipped over my bike, landing primarily on my knee, ripping my pants and breaking my sunglasses (I was wearing a helmet too). The two men from the service truck (maybe for sewage?) had no signs or anything (signs) to alert cyclists of the obstacle and danger. My knee and leg were very cut up and bloody -- I eventually got up moved myself and my bike out of the bike lane, called a coworker to meet me with a first aid kit a few blocks away, and told the work men they needed to move the hose since it was a hazard to anyone in the bike lane. I didn\\'t call the police but I did report the incident both to 311 and DDOT.\"\\n63673175,6810,Arlington,VA,22203,Crash Description,\"Traveling down Custis into the District, crossing over driveway in front of Key Bridge Marriott.

I yelled, we both slammed on the brakes. I swerved and managed to miss hitting their driver side door/window, but did hit the front of their car and rolled over the hood. I was fine, not even bruised. But my bike left a big scratch in their car. They said it wasn\\'t their fault because they couldn\\'t see me and claimed that they had turned slowly. They demanded that I pay for it, but I refused and said they were at fault for failing to yield when turning. I\\'m not sure of their speed, but they were definitely in a hurry to beat traffic and get left. We exchanged phone numbers, and got the number of a bystander. They have not followed up.\"\\n63724243,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"Very congested traffic with multiple cars double parked. I was riding my bike northbound 18th st, with a car in front of me. The driver at a single parked car next to me opens the door i have enough time that i try to avoid it but dont jave room to turn due to traffic so i hit the door with the right side of thd handlebar, crashing into the trunk of the car infront of me. Guy asks me if im ok and tells me he didnt see me. No one stepped out of cars or sidewalk. Picked up myself and yelled at him that it was a bikelane and he shouldve look. He did NOT know 18th st has a bikelane. Left flustered and with a limp but not aching. Got home and realized i scraped my knee.\"\\n63727693,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was riding in the right-most travel lane about 2-feet off the curb to make sure I was visible.

I was thrown forward off my bike, which she then ran over.\"\\n63729730,6810,Washington,DC,20005,Crash Description,\"I was going straight through the intersection traveling east on L Street NW. As I entered the intersection (which is actually a three-street intersection), the car just ahead of me did not slow (and if its turn signal was on, I did not see it) as it turned onto New Hampshire, which is the second left after the 22nd street turn. I was unable to brake/turn out of the way fast enough, followed the end of the car for a few feet in parallel, before being knocked off my bicycle by the car\\'s bumper. After speaking to the driver, he said he had only been looking to his right, indicating an ignorance of the bike lane\\'s presence to his left.\"\\n63730233,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I was riding my bicycle southbound on 11th street and, having assessed that the traffic light was green and the intersection clear, I proceeded through the intersection. A driver traveling in the northbound lane approached the intersection and made a left turn through the intersection, and collided with me. I was struck on my left side and was ejected from the bike. I was airborne before striking the ground. My knees, feet, elbow, hands, and head struck the ground. I landed at corner of the intersection nearest to Tyler Elementary and just in front of the crosswalk. My bike was on the other side of the crosswalk (north of where I landed), and my purse, bike lock, and shoes were strewn across the intersection between myself and the bike. Several bystanders helped me keep calm when I landed, but the driver did not approach me or attempt to see if I was alright. I was able to sit up but unable to move further until being assessed by an EMT on the ground and then assisted into an ambulance. I was evaluated in the ambulance but elected not to be transported to a hospital. I did seek medical attention, including evaluation for a concussion and x-rays of my knees and feet the following day. A police officer was also present at the scene and took a statement from myself and the driver. The driver was declared to be at fault and was issued a citation, and a police report was filed.\"\\n63732852,6810,Arlington,VA,22201,Crash Description,\"I believe I had the green heading south on 15th. it was 5pm so theres traffic. I saw heavier than normal pedestrian traffic so I figure I\\'d ride between the tour buses and cars and take the 14th st bridge to Arlington rather than Constitution Ave. The other cyclist in the crosswalk rides in front of a car (I couldnt see her or brake in time). As I pass the car on 15th she appears and then I hit her as she\\'s crossing. My guess? she didn\\'t cross in time but I could be wrong, everything happens very fast and signage here for bikes isnt great. I could be wrong here but I\\'ve biked this for over a year and I\\'m super cautious with all the tourists in this area\"\\n63735243,6810,Washington,DC,20016,Crash Description,\"I was headed south, downhill. Tunlaw has alternate side parking restrictions, so there is no parking on the right side of the street in the morning. As I approached, a driver was parked on the right, brake lights on, no turn signal. I thought he was waiting for me to pass before pulling out of the parking space. As it turns out, he was moving his car from one side of the street to the other, and just as I passed he unexpectedly made a u-turn into me. I hit the driver\\'s side front fender and was thrown over the vehicle. The driver and a nearby witness stopped.\"\\n63745531,6810,Washington,DC,20008,Crash Description,\"I rode a bicycle on sidewalk of the east side of Wisconsin Ave NW, heading south. For the walking signal was on and there was no pedestrian traffic, I continued to ride in the crosswalk at a school driveway. A black sedan was approaching on the driveway heading east toward Wisconsin Ave. I expected him to stop. But, he did not stop. He was constantly looking his left side, checking the car traffic on Wisconsin Ave northbound, and did not see me on the bike on his right side. His car (front bumper) hit me (my left foot ) and the left side of my bike . I fell to my right side and hit my right shoulder/back on the ground. He stopped, got off the car, called 911. A witness was walking behind me the same direction I was heading to, and agreed to remain at the site. Police officers did not appear until an ambulance arrived, the paramedics checked on my injuries, and wrote down all my personal information.

The cars in the right lane were moving slowly. A large crack in the road caused me to loose control of my front wheel. As a result, my right hand came into contact with the driver side mirror of a car in the right lane. When I made contact with the mirror, it came off. I pulled off the road and had a cordial conversation with the driver. We exchanged contact information. His insurance company called me a few days later to take a statement. I did not hear from the driver again until April 23rd when he sent me a bill for $871.54.\"\\n63784479,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,There is a sinkhole that is not visible in the dark in the middle of the intersection.

I was riding down I St due to the calmer traffic than New York Ave. I was biking in the right most lane because buses and parked cars often leave the right lane with fewer traveling cars than the middle or left lanes. I passed Franklin Square with the green light continuously crossing 14th St. A car was stopped in the middle of the left lane (I can\\'t remember if it had its flashers on or not) with the rear of the car close to -- if not in -- the cross walk on the west side of the 14th St intersection. Since it was in the middle of the lane, there was plenty of room to pass the stopped car on the right side, especially since there was moving car traffic in the middle lane to the right of the stopped car. Since the car was stopped, I attempted to pass the stopped car on the right. As I was passing the car, the passenger in the back seat opened the right rear passenger door and knocked me off of the bicycle. I sustained no major injuries, only a scrape on my right elbow and three small scrapes on the fingers of both hands. Not wanting to debate with the Uber/Lyft/Ridehailing driver or passenger and realizing I sustained no major injuries, I got up, remounted the bicycle and completed my commute to work continuing on I St.\"\\n63796673,6810,Arlington,VA,22202,Crash Description,\"I was travelling southbound on Army Navy Drive on the sidewalk. The other person was stopped at a stop sign, preparing to turn right onto Army Navy Drive.

At the light the driver started turning left onto P street but was not paying attention. I saw her coming towards me but I assumed she would stop since it looked like she was slowing down. I also had my front light on and the street was well lit, so she should have seen me coming. By the time I realized she was going to hit me it was too late for me to do anything.\"\\n63842219,6810,silver spring,MD,20906,Crash Description,\"I was crossing Hathaway Drive on Layhill Road and there were cars making a right on Layhill from Hathaway Drive. A car let me cross the street, but the car behind that one kept driving and hit my back tire. The lady put her windows down and apologized to me, but she did not stop!

She knew she hit me and when she drove off she was swerving everywhere.\"\\n63844875,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I was not involved, I am reporting this for my friend who was involved.

Fortunately, we both saw each other in time to break and I hit the front of his truck with my left side. My life was spared and walked away with just a few scratches to my arm and some bloodied knuckles. The driver made some comments that I could not hear due to noise pollution (and his loud truck), but he did not get out of his truck to check on me, he just sped away. I did not see a company advertised on the truck. I only remember the 225 part of the license (225 with 4 digits after that). It was a red and white truck, however, the front portion of the truck was red and the dump back part was white.\"\\n63892577,6810,Arlington,VA,22207,Crash Description,\"The trail is lined with a temporary wire mesh fence because of the construction on Beach Drive. Someone pulled back the fence to access the tunnel and left a section of it sticking into the trail. I rode straight into it without seeing it and was thrown over the handlebars onto my right shoulder. That fence should really be the plastic orange fencing that is more common at construction sites.

The driver stopped. she had two passengers. They all got out. A nurse cycling by stopped, too, as did a few other people. Unfortunately, I was so shaken up I only got the nurse\\'s name--probably because she stayed with me until the end. The fire trucks and MPD came. I was able to ride away after the whole crash, luckily.\"\\n63907769,6810,Fairfax,VA,22031,Crash Description,Speeding black Toyota Sienna (recent year) tried to speed around me on a turn.

It looks like they ripped the pole out of one, but the roughly 5-inch-tall grounded, plastic, round, part is still in the middle of the bike lane. It\\'s easy to miss, and I hit it. Bike chain is messed up, and I rolled into traffic, which was stopped at the time.\"\\n63915840,6810,chillum,MD,20782,Crash Description,\"As I crossed Carson Circle in the crosswalk, on my bike w/ a headlight and a tailight, a black Mecedes was making a right turn onto Michigan/Queens Chapel. The driver did not look right before he turned, only left. As I realized this, it was too late to avoid entering the crosswalk, but it was not too late to accelerate past this car while remaining in the crosswalk. With my front wheel nearly on the far sidewalk, I was struck my rear wheel by a blue Nissan/Mazda making a left turn from Michigan/Queens onto Carson Circle. Neither driver stopped or, to the best of my knowledge, even slowed.

I was in the designated bike share lane. I indicated to the truck driver that he was too close but he accelerated and got within two feet of hitting. He was clearly trying to force me to the side of the road, but cars on the right prevented that and I was in the bike share lane anyway. After continuing to accelerate in a threatening manner, he eventually increased speed and passed on my left by entering the parking lane at an unsafe speed and within a foot to my left. When he stopped to pick up trash, I rode back and attempted to take a photo of his plate number. Seeing me do this he sped off, again coming within one foot of hitting me. Grounds staff in front of the Natural History Museum witnessed this and commented on the danger the driver posed. I only got a partial of the plate number as when he sped off it put it out of focus (he had one VA plate and a yellow DC plate above it). The passenger door however indicated the contractor as Bates Trucking and Trash Removal, solid waste removal number 239 (dated 2016 so expired), USDOT 653767. I will also contact the US Park Service t, so if same contractor involved in a crash in the future they can be potentially be held liable for retaining their services after being noticed of reckless driving.\"\\n64113350,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I was traveling in the bike lane going straight on New Jersey Ave Se, and had a green light.

As I entered the intersection, a car came down the ramp and slowed down, but the driver never looked right (or even straight ahead) - - he only looked left to see if he could make an illegal right on red. He continued into the crosswalk, still looking left. I saw that he was not stopping and was not looking and swerved to try to avoid the crash (though I could not swerve out into Maine Ave as there was traffic). As a result the impact was primarily from pedals back. I was thrown from my bike (in the direction the car was going) and hit my helmeted head on the street pretty hard.\"\\n64166589,6810,Washington,DC,20020,Crash Description,\"The car was to the right of the bike like (left turn lane is to the left of the bike lane).

Uhle and S. Troy streets. This is near the water treatment plant, that area cyclists may be familiar with. It was about 9:30 pm and we were almost to our destination (the Villages at Shirlington). A set of oncoming cars approached. We were not paying much attention. I heard some laughter and also faintly think I recognized Latin music coming from the direction of the cars. Someone on the passenger side of one of the cars threw a large glass object (such as a vase or large beer mug, or a liquor bottle) at us. I presume they were juvenile delinquents who saw my bike light and impulsively decided to throw something towards us at random as they passed. I was hit in the mouth and bicep, and immediately went down to the pavement. My friend went down in the grass avoiding a collision with me. I almost fell toward the street where there was oncoming traffic. By the time my friend and I gathered ourselves, the car was long gone, and we had no material description. The act was extremely cruel and clearly intended to maim or kill someone at random. I suffered numerous injuries, and had to go to the ER, where I received X’rays, wound cleaning, and other treatment. My bike was also damaged. As I write this, I am unable to travel to work, and may need to have a medical procedure done to address one of the complications. An online police report was filed with Arlington County PD on 8/20. It has to be online because I live in Alexandria, and they will not take an in-person report out of the county. Due to my injuries, I cannot travel just yet. WABA should also note that the ACPD does not include bike trails in their online report location type drop-down selector, and that should be an option. Finally, to date, it appears no one in the group of cars called ACPD to report the violent incident – I’m sure someone saw it. The attack was senseless and cruel, cyclists should be warned to watch out in the area, and I pray the perpetrators get caught because they should not be on the streets. They have ruined all my near-term plans, and I was lucky not to be more seriously injured or killed.\"\\n64233370,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"At this intersection, cars going west on Mass Ave always block the intersection, so bikes in the 2-way bike lane have to weave through.

What Iremember is the third bicycle came veering sharply out of the cluster and crossed into my lane and popped a big wheelie. I remember making eye contact with him and recognizing he had no intention of stopping. The look in his eyes made me think he was trying to intimidate me and was intentionally acting malicious. The next thing I remember is someone asking me for an unlock code for my phone, or something to do with verifying my wifes contact info.

The inertia then caused me to go flying over my handlebars, landing headfirst, on the rare day when I happened to not be wearing a helmet. The driver never stopped, leaving me in the street on my own.\"\\n64474082,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"This incident happened behind me, so I didn\\'t see it but only heard the collision. Based on the scene itself and what passers-by were saying this is what happened: A bike was heading south in the bike lane on 1st St. NE, crossing the intersection, and as he was doing so, a tan economy-sized car (DC license plate BK 8370 (I\\'m almost certain)) turned left without yielding to the biker and collided with him while turning. As soon as I heard the collision, I looked behind me, saw what happened, and returned about the 50 feet or so to the intersection, which I had just crossed through. It was morning commute time, so there were lots of witnesses and people gathered in the few seconds it took me to get back to the scene. The driver of the car had stopped and was waiting there. There were also first responders who just happened to be half a block up the street. They immediately came to the scene. Because there were the first responders and so many witnesses there, I just took note of the scene details and the license plate and left.\"\\n64487906,6810,Virginia Beach,VA,23455,Crash Description,\"We believe that the Virginia Department of Transportation is charged with maintaining this electronic gate/barrier crosses to vehicular lanes of travel at 900 Royal St. near the intersection with Jones Point Drive. The metal barrier stretches across two lanes of traffic and is intended to stay in the upright raised, position at all times unless a motor vehicle is authorized to pass, the operator of the vehicles enter a code in a keypad on either side of the gate. Once the keypad is properly accessed, the metal gate retracts downwards into the asphalt where it remains virtually hidden. The husband-and-wife were visiting Alexandria and planning to bike the Mount Vernon Trl. for the first time and as they approached the area, they had no idea there was a hidden barrier recessed in the asphalt. Just as they approached this particular gate area, apparently a vehicle passed slowly northbound through the malfunctioning gate/barrier. And the malfunctioning gate/barrier suddenly rose from its recess position, when the husband\\'s front tire hit the barrier as it rose sending him sprawling to the pavement where he was paralyzed and could not move. His wife also struck the barrier and his bike and fell to the pavement suffering injuries. Investigation has shown that the gate/barrier malfunctions and stays in the recessed hidden position in the pavement although it should at all times be in the upright position when a vehicle has not passed through. The malfunction creates a serious safety hazard because the gate will rise once a vehicle passes or it becomes free of whatever is stopping it from raising to the upright position. Besides malfunctioning, there are no signs on the road on either side of the approach warning bicyclists that they must travel on the sidewalk and not on either lane of the S. Royal St. roadway.\"\\n64497455,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,Was bike riding in right lane of Hain\\'s Point loop parallel to the Potomac.

He revved his engine to intimidate me.\"\\n64526106,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I was cycling southbound on the sidewalk just south of New York Avenue (the bike lane on 7th disappears after N Street NW, and traffic was heavy so I moved over to 6th Street to make it easier to turn left onto K headed back to Capitol Hill). When I got to 6th, traffic was crazy, so - from the intersection of NY Ave and 6th, I looked down the sidewalk, saw no pedestrians, so decided that would be the safest route. An SUV pulled out of a parking lot at 6th and NY Ave, headed onto 6th. She wasn\\'t looking up the sidewalk (she said this several times), and just pulled across the sidewalk without looking, and ran into me as I was riding down the sidewalk. The police report cites her for \\'failure to yield\\'. I suffered a tibial plateau fracture, and compression, had surgery on October 23rd, and will be on crutches until mid-January.

In the morning I bike west towards Foggy bottom. On 11/21/2017, I left my residence at about 8am and started biking along Rhode Island Ave. When I was near 6th St NW, a car started honking at me while I was biking in the rightmost lane. I assumed that the driver was unhappy with me. The honking continued for 10-20 seconds. I ignored the driver\\'s honking. Right after I passed the intersection of Rhode Island Ave and R St, the car passed me on my left side and struck me. I do not know which part of the car hit me. I fell down and the car left the scene. I was able to get off of the road and to beckon to a police officer who was across the street at the 7-Eleven gas station.

I was riding up the right side of the cars, between the idling cars and the parked cars, and a parked car opened its door in front of me. I swerved into the line of cars to avoid the door. I was mostly successful, but the door hit my pannier and back wheel.\"\\n64576104,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I have no memory of the crash as I woke up in the hospital 7 or 8 hours later but from what others have told me ... I live in DC and was commuting to my job in Alexandria near King Street Station. I believe I had a collision with another cyclist at the point where there is a sharp bend on the trail immediately after the ramp off the Mount Vernon Trail. For riders coming from DC, it is easy to build up excessive speed on the steep ramp and then swing out too wide on the turn putting you on the wrong side of the path. Conversely, if headed toward DC, it is tempting to cut the corner to maintain speed to get up the steep ramp. I like to think I was not at fault since I had ridden to work most week days for 3 years but I do not know. I am guessing our handlebars impacted turning my front wheel abruptly left but I kept going straight and landed in such a way that I broke my right collar bone, fractured two vertebrae (the neurologist emphasized that I had come perilously close to being a quadriplegic) and sustained a skull fracture that has left me deaf in my right ear. Yes, I was wearing a helmet. I believe someone from the airport fire station was on the scene very soon afterwards (maybe he was cycling to work; I was told he was on his way to work but as best I can tell, you can\\'t see where I believe the crash happened from the road). As it happened, the airport ambulance was on another call so an ambulance from Arlington came to collect me and took me to Virginia Hospital Center. My bike ended up at the airport fire station but there is nothing in their log book about the incident. I was told that was because Arlington\\'s ambulance personnel attended to me. I believe the other guy was fine and stayed around until I was taken away. Regardless of who was on which side of the path, I regard the real problem to be one of infrastructure - the steep ramp followed by the turn makes for a dangerous combination. I believe the land is under the jurisdiction of the National Parks Service and I thought about writing to them about addressing it but (1) the NPS is impoverished and probably can\\'t fix it even if the want to (2) given the restrictions of the adjacent roads, it isn\\'t clear to me how it could be fixed. The next question should be \"\"Were the emergency services called? \"\", not specifically the police.\"\\n64597277,6810,Washington,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"Stopped at red light crossing Hst NE Northbound.

I was in the left lane and there was a car turning left at the bottom of the hill. The car behind this turning vehicle immediately merged into the right lane without waiting for there to be space in the right lane, causing the cars in the right lane to stop to let him in. So now both lanes were suddenly stopped. I grabbed my brakes and my rear wheel started to skid. I merged into the right lane and swerved around a stopped van and jumped off my bike onto the sidewalk. My bike fell onto the sidewalk, but was fine, as was I.

I was riding a yellow ofo bike which is loud, and had a glass tupperware loudly clanging in the metal basket at the front of the bike. Biking down 21st towards New Hampshire I was on the sidewalk as that is a one-way street, narrow, with parked cars on both sides and morning commuters zooming by. Typically I ride on the sidewalk on 21st for 2 blocks (from Newport Place to New Hampshire) and then get in the bike lane on M Street the rest of my commute. As I was clanging loudly down the street I called out to a man in front of me, at least 3 and possible 4 times, \"\"EXCUSE ME\"\" but he made no efforts to move. As that sidewalk is right in front of an apartment building with cement planters, and bordered on the other side by parkway with trees and vegetation, it is too narrow to pass by someone. As the ofo bikes are a bit heavy and I was wearing a dress (on way to work) I was already going very slowly, and slowed down even further upon approaching the unmoving man. As I came to a complete stop the very front of my tire may have lightly nicked his heel, but I\\'m unsure. Either way, he was 100% fine and I would certainly say I didn\\'t hit him. He whipped around and started screaming expletives at me that I should be in the street and backed me up into the apartment building. As I was on this pretty heavy bike I couldn\\'t get away and he continued to heavily intimidate me as I backed up, and screamed at me demanding an apology. Obviously frightened, I did apologize profusely while also repeatedly asking him to stop touching me as he kept grabbing my hand and reaching for my arm as he screamed at me and boxed me in. I couldn\\'t get away from him nor calm him down. Finally he stopped momentarily and I had to bike back a bit and then around him because he wouldn\\'t let me continue on the sidewalk. I biked across New Hampshire and up M Street for a few more blocks before I felt like I was a safe distance away, hopped off the bike, and shaken up walked the rest of the way to work.\"\\n64665088,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"Was headed eastbound n the bike lane on G St. NW, between 11th. St. NW and 10th St. NW when a driver just swung the door wide open. I didn’t even have time to brake. I just hit the door and went over the handle bars. My left arm took the brunt of the force as I hit the ground.

I was solidly in the bike lane, and a black Toyota Camry (Uber) was passing me. I signaled that I was moving forward and would take a right at the end of the street, where 18th, Connecticut, and N Streets NW meet. He then slowed down right where the lane on 18th Street narrows, just past the garage, and grazed my left side with his mirror, which pulled me under his car. I fell on my left leg, arm, and hand. Had he rolled forward two inches further with his right-side back passenger wheel, he would have crushed my skull. I was wearing a helmet and gloves, which helped prevent further injury and lacerations. There was a slight scratch on the left side of his car where he hit me. My front reflector snapped off and my seat got twisted to the left. There were three witnesses at the scene who pulled me up off the ground. One of them called the policy and the EMT. The Uber passenger left the scene before the police got there -- she was a block away from her final destination. The Uber driver behaved very aggressively and blamed me for the incident, even though I was in the correct lane, signaled clearly, and was trying to let him pass.\"\\n64695283,6810,Arlington,VA,22207,Crash Description,\"no crash, just honking for no reason\"\\n64704267,6810,Arlington,VA,22201,Crash Description,I was riding on my way to work towards foggy bottom on M St NW when a guy opened his door into traffic.

We both had green lights. He slowed down looking for a break in traffic to turn left onto 30th St NW. Accelerated when he though he had a break in traffic, but I was traveling through the intersection at that point. I was too far into the intersection to swerve or brake hard enough to avoid getting hit, and my front wheel hit his front passenger side bumper. I rolled onto his hood and windshield then onto the ground in the pedestrian crosswalk. I did not loose consciousness but immediately had intense pain followed by numbness of my left knee, shin, and ankle. Pedestrians who were witnesses to the crash surrounded me to help lay me straight on the intersection and called 911. The driver remained on the scene. The police arrived, followed by an ambulance. Police inspected my bike and helmet for damage. The bike was overall in tact but the fork was out of alignment and noticeably looser and the chain was completely loose . In a subsequent inspection I found that multiple wheel spokes on the front wheel were loose. I received treatment in the ambulance - EMTs cut open my jeans on my left leg to assess damage. The leg from the knee down was quickly swelling, along with a knot on my right leg about two inches above my knee. I had full mobility in my spine but notice that my head felt too heavy to hold up on its own. EMTs took my vitals and went through a series of tests with me in which I pushed my left foot like I was pushing a gas pedal, and checked for any numbness in my left leg. After passing those tests they gave me the option to go to the hospital. I was still shaken up but did not feel that ambulance transport to the hospital was necessary and elected to wait and recover from the emotional and physical trauma from the back of the ambulance while the police finished their report and while I waited on my husband to arrive on the scene - I had one of the witnesses to the crash call him from my cell phone to tell him where I was shortly after the police and ambulance had been called. Once the police report had been completed and I had the incident report number and my husband arrived, I had him take me to the GWU emergency room for a full assessment and x-rays.\"\\n64712114,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\\n64715108,6810,Washington,DC,20007,Crash Description,\"While cycling in the protected bike lane heading east on L st., a car took a left turn across the bike lane to enter a garage without giving me enough space to halt my bicycle.

He ended up going directly toward me and trying to skid out of the way, and I wasn\\'t able to fully dodge his rear wheel in time. My front tire hit his spokes pretty hard, which likely caused a significant shock to my frame, and I flew forward off of my bike (don\\'t remember if I was completely separated from it or not). I didn\\'t notice much damage to the frame until after riding home completely normally and inspecting further. Neither bike appeared to have received much damage to speak of directly after the crash (besides superficial scrapes and my left handlebar/shifter), but I later noticed that my frame became bent in two spots.

There was also another car parked to my right which limited my ability to veer and avoid the crash.\\n64897251,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"I was biking north on 3rd St NW, and signaled that I was going to make a left turn onto Whittier St NW. There was a car coming down Whittier going east that stopped for the stop sign there, presumably before turning right (to go south on 3rd). As I was turning left another car came quite quickly from behind the one that was stopped, it drove around the stopped car and through the stop sign and began to turn left from Whittier (onto 3rd going north), into me as I was mid-turn. The driver stopped to make sure I was \"\"okay\"\" but left immediately when I said it probably wasn\\'t necessary to call the police (and before I thought to ask for insurance information).\"\\n64897505,6810,Alexandria,VA,22301,Crash Description,\"I was on the sidewalk in front of the Washington Monument, 15th street, east side, and entered the crosswalk on Jefferson Street, when a Green Camry ( older, ~ 2004-8? turned left in front of me. I slammed on brakes, allowing me not to be hit by the car, but went over my handlebars in the process, crashing on the street. The car kept going. A bike behind me who was a witness followed the car, got its license plate and spoke to the driver. The driver turned right on 14th street and sped off.\"\\n64902146,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"I was in the bike lane on 11th Street headed southbound. At the intersection with P Street, the light was green and I continued straight. The Prius made a quick right turn - the driver did not signal or slow down, and clearly did not look to see whether there was anyone in the bike lane, and did not see me. I tried to turn out of the way as he turned onto P Street, and yelled out. I am not sure whether I hit his car, but I skidded and ended up falling. The driver did stop to check on me, let me take photos of his driver\\'s license, license plate, and insurance.\"\\n64908152,6810,Arlington,VA,22201,Crash Description,\"This report is for my son, who was involved in the crash. He was riding his bike uphill on Clarendon on the sidewalk on the south side of the street (it was night and dark, he had a light and taillight). A driver pulled out of the parking garage and broadsided him, trapping his front wheel under the car. The bike was totaled but he was uninjured. He did not know that he should call the police.\"\\n64921346,6810,Springfiled,VI,22151,Crash Description,\"This morning on the way to work, I was riding in side the bike lane on Gallows, then an suv approached to me and cut on front of me, into the bike lane then yelled at me \"\"Get the f..k out of here\"\" then showed me his finger, I was able to take a picture of this two young males driven on a Red SUV Mercedes, with license place XUP-7625. I didn\\'t get involve into any crash, just want to report the incident. Thanks Truc Ngo\"\\n64924937,6810,washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"Cars stopped at red light on 10th going in South direction at New York. I was in the bike lane riding toward the light. Suddenly, a right rear passenger door of a dark SUV like vehicle opened into the bike lane in front of me. In a flash, I went down after colliding with the door. My left hand was cut inside the palm near the index finger, probably from the door and my right knee took an abrasion from the street. I did not notice anything else at the time.\"\\n64941051,6810,Silver Spring,MD,20904,Crash Description,\"I was rolling downhill and the driver coming towards me in the opposite lane made a sudden left turn across my path, cutting me off. It was a straight clear road (no cars moving in front of the driver, no cars parked on the street that could obscure his view), and he had plenty of time to see me coming before turning in my way. I gripped my brakes, but he didn\\'t slow down, and still clipped the front of my bike, toppling my over his hood along with the bike, cracking the frame in 2 places. He then sped off as I lay on the ground, dazed. Fortunately, there had been several witnesses who were on the sidewalk when this all took place, and they were able to corroborate my account to the police once we had officers on scene. The impact to the ground immediately resulted in road rash, and body aches, which got checked out when I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.\"\\n64941622,6810,Alexandria,VA,22307,Crash Description,I think it was a tourist who ran into me as he was on what I recall as a rental bicycle. I can\\'t recall exactly since I hit the back of my head on the trail\\'s pavement My helmet cracked completely apart in the back but saved my life.\\n64945895,6810,Washington,DC,20007,Crash Description,\"I was traveling down H Street NW between 17th and 18th Streets NW. I was in the right lane, with parked cars to my right and moving traffic to my left. I was moving at approximately the speed of traffic, slowly overtaking traffic. A taxi was on my left, I was even with approximately the right back quarter panel or passenger door. The row of parked cars ended on my right and the taxi immediately merged to the right, causing an immediate impact. The taxi did not signal, slow, or otherwise indicate any awareness of my presence. I went over the front handlebars, hitting the ground with my helmet and face, followed by arms and chest. MPD and DCFD responded and I was transported to GW and treated as an adult trauma. Only injuries were abrasions to face, arms, and legs, no broken bones or internal injuries, head saved by helmet. MPD wrote me a ticket for creating an unsafe condition based on competing testimony between myself and the taxi driver. The taxi driver did not receive a ticket. Cameras at nearby buildings likely captured the incident.\"\\n64962814,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"This was NOT a crash. It was an incident with a driverless car, plate 14975 (with a C above an H at the end) - a Maryland plate. The car passed within a few inches of me and there was literally no-one in the car. It make no attempt to obey the 3 ft rule.\"\\n64989084,6810,Washington,DC,20003,Crash Description,\"I got on my bike on the north side of the street and crossed to get to the south side to drive east. I thought I\\'d cleared the streetcar tracks, but I didn\\'t. My front wheel got stuck in the track and I fell forward onto my handlebars and the pavement. Fortunately, there was very little traffic and two pedestrians came to my aid.\"\\n64995206,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"Hi there. I don\\'t have a memory of the accident, unfortunately, but have been trying to piece together info based on talking to 911. I was traveling south on 13th in the direction of Logan Circle as that\\'s the way I go to work. My last memory was that of biking the normal route further north on 13th and being at a stop sign. I assumed the crash was near there as that was my last memory, but turns out that 911 said the report they got was a biker matching my description was hit by a car near 13th and W. My only memory is being inside the ambulance, but unfortunately don\\'t know other details. I was traveling on a Capital Bikeshare bike - bike# W20011. To my surprise someone docked the bike at 11th and S for me after I was taken to the hospital. That was nice of them.\"\\n64995251,6810,Washington,DC,20007,Crash Description,\"Signaled to turn left and took the lane. As I began to make my turn left onto Fessenden, a car attempted to speed pass me on the left, nearly into opposing lanes.\"\\n65010091,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,I was biking down 18th st in the bike lane. I approached the intersection of 18th and Kalorama where I had a green light. The driver was slightly in front of me and took a quick right turn. I did not have enough time to brake quickly and he turned into me knocking me off my bicycle. My bicycle was damaged pretty badly in the accident. Luckily I left with a few scrapes and some gnarly bruises. A police report was filed but I opted not to go to the hospital.\\n65010826,6810,Washington,DC,20011,Crash Description,\"I was riding my bike southbound through the cross walk on 15th Street NW to get onto the bike lane across the street. I had the pedestrian go signal and right of way. This guy was traveling northbound on 15th street and had been waiting at the light - as soon as his light changed he gunned it into a left turn and hit me with the front of his truck, knocking me down and off my bike. He claimed I was in his blind spot and that he didn\\'t see me.\"\\n65020679,6810,Arlington,VA,22203,Crash Description,\"I was cycling down hill on Clarendon Blvd. There was a metro bus stopped in the bike lane. To avoid hitting the back of the bus I checked that there was no oncoming traffic in the main lain, there wasn\\'t, so I moved left out of the bike lane into the main lane. However, there was a stopped car (sedan) that I could not see because the bus blocked my line of sight. I rear ended the sedan. My head went through the rear windshield of the car. My bicycle was totaled, the top tube and down tube snapped.\"\\n65021240,6810,Arlington,VA,22204,Crash Description,Cab was in right lane and decided to make a left turn with no regard to looking at blind spot.\\n65022130,6810,Washington,DC,20005,Crash Description,I was cycling on the crosswalk with the green light and a car that turn was not looking ahead and crash me.\\n65028135,6810,Washington,DC,20015,Crash Description,\"I am not reporting a crash, I am reporting harassment: An UBER driver needed to use the bathroom and decided drive over the Bicycle lanes for good 80 yards and parked the car in the middle of the bicycle lane fully blocking the two bicycle lanes to use a porta-potty on the opposite side of the street, left the car with the hazard lights on and the customer passenger in the car. I could not go through the side as I ride a recumbent bicycle. When the driver returned and I complained, the driver (young African- American) man charged at me raised the fists and threatened to hit me, then went in the car, but suddenly, and unprovoked, he changed his mind and reopened the door and came back once again to insult me, charged at me and once again raised his fists and threatened to hit me, this time from very close range. I am a middle age man with everything to loose in a fist fight against such a strong, agile and aggressive individual. Moreover, this is the THIRD CONSECUTIVE day that I see cars using the bicycle lane to bypass traffic during the rush hour forcing me to move over to the side. Please alert police or do something about this because we are about to have a serious accident there. In the three instances, not only the cars drove in the bicycle lane, but they did it at considerable speed. There is simply no respect for cyclists in this new bicycle lane because it is a very crowded area, the lane connects with the main road at several sections and there is simply no enforcement from police whatsoever.\"\\n65031916,6810,Arlington,VA,22201,Crash Description,\"I was headed towards Rosslyn from Spout Run direction on the sidewalk of Lee Highway with my bike (including a bright green burley trailer and flags), preparing to cross Calvert and turn left onto Calvert Street to access the Custis bike path. The driver was looking towards Rosslyn at oncoming traffic as she anticipated a right-hand turn. Because the traffic she was entering was one-way, she did not look right and proceeded just as I was crossing in front of her. She hit me on the bike directly. She did stop and check for my safety, assisted me, and offered to call police (I declined). Another cyclist also stopped. We all exchanged information. I continued on my bike ride with some minor bumps and bruises. I later realized my helmet was scratched, but that could be from prior use. My cycling equipment also seems fine.\"\\n65032704,6810,Washington,DC,20009,Crash Description,\"I was traveling in the bike lane on 13th St NW going north. The bike lane ends at the south end of Logan Circle and so cyclists are forced into the outside lanes which are both torn lanes. I needed to continue around the circle which means I had to merge over in traffic across 3 lanes, 2 of which are turn lanes. As I am trying to merhe over to the left, a vehicle comes up from behind me in the adjacent turn lane and turns right and collides into me on my left side. The police report ruled the vehicle had the right of way because she was in the turn lane turning and I was attempting to merge over. The officer took my statement as I was convulsing on the ground hardly able to speak.\"\\n65040829,6810,Washington,DC,20012,Crash Description,\"I was riding along the bike path and as my front wheel was passing the half way mark of the car the door opened really fast. I tried to turn out the way but it was close to impossible to do so. As I crashed into the car door I flipped over my bike, bounced off of my back onto my front, my left knee landing first, my left elbow landing second, my right knee landing third and then I spun back onto my back. I was in shock and didn\\'t really recognize what was happening after that. All I saw was the driver moving my bike out of the street and in front of my car. I was shaking and slowly scooted to the curb. I didn\\'t immediately feel any pain so I slowly got up. My left leg was shaking but I assumed it was just adrenaline. I\\'m not sure where the driver went but he came back after a couple minutes had passed. Asked me if I was ok and I replied \"\"I think\"\". He lingered around for a minute while I tried to fix my bike; which the steering wheel was crooked, the chain completely off, and the gears bent; and then said \"\"good luck\"\" and drove off.\"\\n65040978,6810,Washington,DC,20017,Crash Description,\"I was heading north in the tunnel in rock creek park in the tunnel near Calvert st. Another rider was in the tunnel, walking his bike southbound. There was not enough room for me to pass by him. My left shoulder struck his bike (handlebars or pedals I’m not sure which) and I am bruised. I reported this because while the paths that enter into the zoo are closed, the tunnel is very dangerous. I suggest signs asking everyone to walk their bikes to avoid future collisions.\"\\n65043460,6810,Washington,DC,20037,Crash Description,\"I was exiting Dupont circle on my bike, turning north on New Hampshire and staying in the bike lane. The driver of the cab opened his door, and I was hit. I was thrown from my bike, over the car door and into the road. I was wearing a helmet, but hurt on the right side of my body.\"\\n65044743,6810,Alexandria,VA,22304,Crash Description,Riding north at 23 mph on mt Vernon trail when front wheel contacted buckled pavement. Front wheel immediately haled - launching me over handlebars facedown onto pavement. further investigation of buckled pavement showed two 6-8 inch tall sharp buckles in pavement approximately 24 inches apart.\\n65046556,6810,Washington,DC,20001,Crash Description,\"This section of New York Ave breaks off off into I street to the right and is separated by a triangular median, the bike lane continues straight while cars merge right towards I street. On multiple occasions cars neglect to let the bike lane clear before merging across the bike lane onto I street and I have been right hooked here multiple times in the past year. There is a bottleneck for cars merging towards I street and cars often cross multiple lanes of traffic to merge ahead of others without looking.\"\\n65047029,6810,Alexandria,VA,22314,Crash Description,\"I was heading south on the MVT when another cyclist heading north, downhill and traveling at a high rate of speed came into my lane and crashed into me.\"\\n65058751,6810,Bethesda,MD,20814,Crash Description,\"BOTH crashes were near misses. Cyclist raced into the street from the north, on the path, from behind a vegetation barrier that keeps him from seeing the cars and keeps car drivers from seeing him. Based on their clothing both men were experienced cyclists. Neither stopped after the near miss, but the driver was badly shaken. The same visibility problem exists from the north on the next two streets to the south, Rosedale and Maple. I have contacted the MoCo Dept of Transportation this morning, and I hope they will call to discuss it. This short bike path is part of the \"\"Georgetown Branch Trail Detour\"\" and is probably being used by commuter cyclists not familiar with the trail.\"\\n65059462,6810,Barnesville,MD,20838,Crash Description,\"I was biking with a friend, we were at the tail end of a 28 mile loop from Barnesville to Poolesville and beyond. As I approached the bottom of a hill on Sellman Road, I made a sharp right turn onto Barnesville Road. My friend and I always use the downhill speed to ease into an uphill. There was low visibility in the right turn onto Barnesville Road, due to a high corn crop on the left and no visbility on the right due to a stone train trestle wall. My friend was ahead of me, she had made the turn. I came down Sellman and made the turn with some speed, (bad idea) and instead of my friend being into the uphill after the turn, her bike was immediately infront of me, her back tire was at a slight angle to my front tire. I could not go around her due to that angle and as I encountered her tired I braked too fast to avoid crashing our bikes. That sent me over my bike into a stone wall 2-3 feet away. I asked my friend to call 911, as my neck was screaming in pain and there was blood on my face. The ambulance came then the two Paramedics called for a second ambulance as my neck had a bulge that concerned them. I was put into a neck brace and then taped to a plastic board, that set onto the ambulance rolling cart. The Paramedics and EMT personell were wonderful and well trained in handling a neck injury. I was taken to a Trauma hospital due to the worry about a fractured neck. The Inova Fairfax hospital staff were also great, very attentive to my injuries.\"\\n65065954,6810,Bethesda,MD,20816,Crash Description,The bridge is made out of plain steel plates which were slicked down. I pulled hard on my brakes but that just caused my wheels to lock and I kept sliding down the ramp. When I hit the short asphalt ramp at the bottom my front wheel locked in place and my rear wheel went up in the air. Despite my best efforts to steady myself I fell off the ramp and onto the sidewalk bellow.\\n65068703,6810,Alexandria,VA,22306,Crash Description,\"I was crossing the street on my bike in the pedestrian crosswalk. Motorist was stopped at a red light and, intending to make a right on red, proceeded without looking in front of him and hit my bike directly as I was right in front of the car at the time. He was looking left checking for a gap in traffic on Route 1 to make a right from Lockheed onto Rt 1 and it doesn\\'t appear that he felt that he hit me because he didn\\'t look in front of him immediately and kept driving, using my bike (my bike was now between me and the car). Then he did look and saw me on the street in front of his car and stopped and exited the car.\"\\n65069782,6810,Arlington,VA,22206,Crash Description,\"A driver of a large green SUV or truck decided to trace me as I was riding eastbound on Maine Ave SW on a morning commute. I was in the far right lane and hugging the shoulder as much as possible when an unknown driver intentionally got as close to me as possible and passed me on the left with much less than 6 inches of clearance. It was a menacing move and intentional and aimed to intimidate since the left of the two lanes was completely unoccupied. According to Strava, I have traversed this road 125 times but this is the first time I have encoutered a menacing driver and felt essentially ran off the road like this. Any sudden moves on my part to avoid road debris would have resulted in a collision with the SUV.\"\\n65070596,6810,Washington,DC,20020,Crash Description,\"I was traveling in the right lane when a car cut over from the left lane to turn into the apartments. However the vehicle made no indication of making a turn, thus it was a sharp turn without the use of a signal. The car and I collided and I Was dragged by the car by the rear-right door. when the car slowed down I then hit my head on the wheel and got my arm ran over.\"\\n65089357,6810,Bethesda,MD,20817,Crash Description,\"Other cyclist did NOT give warning when passing. As he was passing, I called out to him to give warning when passing He stopped ahead of me, and confronted me. He claims I turned my head to see him behind me, and then \"\"hogged\"\" the path. I probably did, but I was expecting him to give warning. When he did not, I called out to him to give warning as he was squeezing by me. That\\'s when he stopped, and confronted me, including knocking me to the ground, as I was trying to pass him. He demanded that I apologize for staying in the center of the trail. I did, because I thought that was the right thing to do, expecting he would apologize for not giving warning. NO WAY did he apologize, even though I asked him to. Luckily, he just rode away. WHAT CAN WE DO TO ENFORCE \"\"GIVE WARNING\"\" RULE???\"\\n65164745,6810,Takoma Park,MD,20912,Crash Description,\"Maxima was parked in the bike lane, dropping off a passenger. I pulled into the car lane to pass the parked car on the left and the driver opened her door at just the wrong time. My front wheel struck the open door, sending me cartwheeling over the door and striking it with my right thigh, knee, and ankle. Landed on the pavement beyond on my head and right shoulder.\"\\n65175904,6810,Washington,DC,20018,Crash Description,\"Riding down Rhode Island, going straight through the intersection with a green light, saw the car turning left, they accelerated to pass through before me, but ended up colliding with the front left quarter of my bicycle. The impact threw me up and onto the windshield of the car, then momentum carried me over and onto the pavement near the drivers side. I landed first on my helmet, then slammed down onto my back. As I lay there she opened her window and said, \"\"(You, or he, can\\'t remember) Had a red light!\"\" Witnesses instantly said that was false. The police arrived quickly and set up the scene, while medical services were called. I stayed where I was, concerned about my spine. EMT\\'s checked spine, assessed consciousness, and allowed me to get up. I then went to the side fo the road where my other injuries were checked out. I have a large number of cuts to my lower back, going down into the muscle, and a broken toe, as well as a number of more minor abrasions across my hands and legs.\"\\n65181539,6810,Washington,DC,20010,Crash Description,\"At the fork before Ohio Drive merges with Maine Avenue I was ahead of an SUV.

Passenger opened back door into my bike as I was riding by- was knocked off bike onto the sidwalk.\\n65195819,6810,WASHINGTON,DC,20002,Crash Description,\"I was riding northbound and 3rd St SE, the car backed out of a parking lot adjacent to 10 3rd St SE and collided with me.\"\\n65212982,6810,Washington,DC,20005,Crash Description,\"I was riding my bike eastbound (From Thomas Circle to Mt. Vernon Sq) on the right lane of Mass Ave when, from the left lane of Mass. Ave, a car that was slowing down turned right in 10th street. The car touched my rear wheel and I fell on the corner of 10 street and Mass. The driver (an african american woman) asked me whether I was OK and, after a few seconds, continue driving southbound (towards the mall) on 10th street. Several bypassers asked her to pull over and wait, but she ignored the request. A bypasser called 911, reporting the accident to the police.\"\\n65213729,6810,Washington,DC,20037,Crash Description,\"I was beginning my bike ride by crossing Pennsylvania Ave (crosswalk was green). The driver was heading north on 22nd St (also green) and turning left onto Pennsylvania when we made contact. I imagine biking on the crosswalk is a gray area?

Driver was traveling SE on Mass Ave and attempting left turn on to D St NE. Left turn is prohibited at that intersection. The way the light operates, traffic traveling NW gets a green light, followed by a Green Light + Left Turn Arrow. Traffic traveling SE turns Red light when NW traffic gets Left Turn Arrow. Car, attempting to make an illegal left turn, had Yellow Light turning Red. Thinking, incorrectly, that NW-traveling traffic also turning red (in fact, we stayed Green and got Green Left Turn arrow), attempted to make illegal left turn when I passed through intersection and was hit.\"\\n65219827,6810,Takoma Park,MD,20912,Crash Description,She ran a stop sign.
